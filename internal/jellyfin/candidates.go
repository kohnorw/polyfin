// A play chooses among a title's versions, in their order: the first that
// plays on the app (see decide), or with PreferDirectPlay the first that
// plays without conversion. The first versions, VersionAttempts of them,
// are analyzed if they were not before; the others are tried only when
// they were, which costs nothing. Up to parallelAttempts of them are read
// at once, a version found unreadable making room for the next: a version
// whose host never answers holds up the play only for versionPatience once
// a later one is ready, rather than for the whole analysis timeout. Each
// analysis runs to its end all the same, and is kept for the next play.
