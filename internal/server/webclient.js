// Polyfin (MIT License). Served at /web/polyfin.js and loaded by the
// index.html of jellyfin-web, which Polyfin ships unmodified. It follows the
// client's routes for three things, adds a style for a fourth, mends a link
// for a fifth, closes a duplicate error for a sixth, leaves libraries out of
// the menus for a seventh, gives members a link to the admin app for an
// eighth, shows a title's three scores for a ninth, adds entries to the
// item menus for a tenth, adds the server's home rows to the home page for
// an eleventh, offers to share a movie or an episode for a twelfth, and adds
// reminders to a programme's page for a thirteenth, makes the server's
// logo, when it has one, the page's icon for a fourteenth, and adds a
// subtitle panel to the video player for a fifteenth.
//
// First, it sends the pages of jellyfin-web that need a Jellyfin server's
// administration, which Polyfin does not have, to Polyfin's admin app. It
// watches the route only, never the page, so that a new jellyfin-web keeps
// working with it. jellyfin-web 12.2 routes after the "#", matched without
// regard to case as its router does, "#!/" being an older form:
//   #/dashboard and every #/dashboard/… page (users, libraries, playback,
//     Live TV, devices, activity, logs, API keys, scheduled tasks, plugins…);
//   #/metadata, the metadata manager;
//   #/configurationpage, plugin configuration pages;
//   #/wizard/…, the startup wizard: Polyfin is set up in its admin app.
// A dashboard page with a match in the admin app opens that page; any other
// opens the admin app's home.
//
// Second, on a title's page (#/details?id=…), it adds the versions of the
// addons that answer after the page opened. Item details list the versions
// Polyfin knows when they are asked, while it asks the other addons in the
// background, and asks each addon again 10 seconds after its first answer,
// then 30 seconds later while its answers grow; /Polyfin/Items/{id}/Versions
// tells how many addons it still asks (Pending) and how many versions
// details list now (Count). Polyfin also pushes it, as it changes, on the
// socket jellyfin-web keeps open, in a PolyfinVersions message whose Data
// names the page's identifier (ItemId): the script hears it through
// ApiClient's message event. It asks at once as the route changes, then
// every second while addons are pending, every 10 seconds once a push came,
// the socket then telling the changes,
// for at most 90 seconds: a first answer, which takes at most 15 seconds,
// and both follow-ups, 10 and 30 seconds later and as long each, end within
// 85. When the page lists fewer versions than Count, or a different number
// once no addon is pending, it asks for the title's details and lists their
// versions in the page's version menu, in place, keeping the version picked.
// It reloads the page's details instead, as jellyfin-web does when the page
// is shown again, when the version picked is gone or no longer the same
// version, since the track menus describe it. The first version carries the
// title's own identifier, and each source its version's own identifier as
// its ETag: when a version listed first takes the title's identifier, or
// Polyfin names the version picked otherwise, the version picked, by
// jellyfin-web or the user, is found by its ETag, else as the one source
// with its name, and its size when both are known, and picked under its
// new identifier before the reload, which jellyfin-web then keeps. It never
// changes the page while a video plays or while the version menu has focus,
// where it could be open: it tries again at the next answer, or as soon as
// the menu loses focus. When the answers say AddVersions false (Settings ›
// Web player › Add versions to an open title's page, off), it only brings
// a menu that lists the placeholder to the versions: the others show when
// the page opens again. Any error just stops it.
//
// Third, on the same page, it holds the play buttons (.btnPlay, .btnResume,
// .btnReplay) until a version is known, as /Polyfin/Items/{id}/Versions and
// its push tell (Known, the placeholder left out). While none is known and
// addons are asked (Pending), they are disabled, greyed, with a spinner and
// the tooltip "Looking for sources…"; as soon as one is known, they are given
// back as jellyfin-web made them. Until the first answer, they are held as
// searching when the version menu lists only the placeholder, a single
// source under the title's own identifier; the first answer may come before
// the title's details asked any addon, so it never tells that no source is
// available. Once no addon is left to ask, they stay disabled and a line
// under them says that no source is available, with a
// "Try again" button: it posts to /Polyfin/Items/{id}/Versions/Search, which
// has Polyfin ask the title's addons again, then follows the versions anew;
// asked too soon, Polyfin answers 429 with Retry-After, and the button waits
// that long. A MutationObserver on the page holds the buttons again when
// jellyfin-web renders it anew. Its words follow jellyfin-web's language, the
// document's lang (English and French, English otherwise). It never changes
// the page during a video, and gives everything back when the route leaves
// the title.
//
// Fourth, it keeps a long name from running under the arrow of the menus of
// a title's page: stream addons name versions with every detail, and
// jellyfin-web leaves no room for the arrow in those menus. Their text ends
// with "…" before it; the open menu still lists whole names.
//
// Fifth, the title of a collection library's "Recently Added" row on the
// home page opens the library on the screen its user chose (Settings › Home
// › Default screen), as the library's links in the header and the menu do.
// jellyfin-web, which calls a library without a CollectionType mixed, opens
// every library's Suggestions from that title (#/mixed?…&tab=1), and a
// collection library has no suggestions of its own. The script drops the
// tab from such a link as it is pressed or clicked, before jellyfin-web
// follows it: pressed covers a link opened in a new tab, clicked one
// followed with the keyboard.
//
// Sixth, it closes the generic error jellyfin-web shows on top of a refused
// playback's own error. When a title's PlaybackInfo answers with an
// ErrorCode, such as the RateLimitExceeded of a user playing on as many
// devices as allowed, jellyfin-web 12.2 explains the code, then rejects the
// playback without a reason, and its rejection handler shows "There was an
// error processing the request" over it: the user meets the wrong error
// first. Of two alerts with the same title shown within a second of each
// other, the first still open, the script hides the second at once, with
// its backdrop, and closes it once it is open, as its button would.
//
// Seventh, it leaves out of jellyfin-web's menus the libraries chosen to be
// hidden there on the Libraries page of Polyfin's admin app, by an
// administrator for the server's libraries or by the user for their own;
// each keeps its row on the home page, and other apps list it. Once a user
// is signed in, it asks /Polyfin/UserViews, which lists the user's views as
// /UserViews does, in its order, each with HideInMenus, and keeps one style
// that hides the links of each such library: the buttons of the top bar
// (jellyfin-web 12.2's UserViewNav, MUI Buttons in the AppBar whose address
// holds the view's identifier), its More menu (#user-view-overflow-menu),
// the side menu of that layout (an MUI Drawer, used below 900 pixels wide
// instead of the buttons) and the legacy layout's side menu
// (.libraryMenuOptions, by data-itemid). Other links to the library, such as
// its home row's title, the tabs of its page or the search button on that
// page, are left alone. The top bar shows the first 3 views, 5 from 1200
// pixels wide and 8 from 1536 (MUI's lg and xl breakpoints), or all of them
// when only one more would go under More, its button listing the rest; the
// views come after config.json's menuLinks, none in the one Polyfin ships.
// Where every view More would list is hidden, its button is hidden too. It
// asks again whenever the user signed in changes, which a route change goes
// with; jellyfin-web may restore the user after the first route, so after
// each route change it looks for the user every second for 30 seconds.
// jellyfin-web draws its menus before the answer comes, so the script keeps
// the last answer in the browser's storage, with the user it was for, and
// applies it as soon as it starts: it runs from the page's head, before
// jellyfin-web's deferred scripts. A user's first load in a browser may
// still show those libraries until the answer comes; every later load hides
// them at once, then asks again and keeps the new answer. The rules kept
// stay while the user signed in is the one they were for; another user's
// are dropped as soon as that user is known, and signing out drops the
// rules but keeps the answer. Storage that fails, or holds anything else,
// counts as none. Any error just stops it.
//
// Eighth, it gives a user signed in who is not an administrator, a member,
// a "Polyfin" entry where jellyfin-web 12.2 shows administrators Dashboard:
// it opens the admin app at /admin/ in the same tab, where the admin app
// signs the member in with the web client's token, as it does an
// administrator. It is named "Polyfin" in every language and drawn as
// Dashboard is, without the Administration heading over it:
//   the default layout's user menu (#app-user-menu), an MUI Menu, as a copy
//     of its Settings item after a divider of its own, before the divider
//     over Quick Connect, Select server and Sign out;
//   the legacy layouts' side menu (.mainDrawer), first in its user section
//     (.userMenuOptions): after the libraries without a heading, where
//     Dashboard is, it would read as one of them;
//   the settings page (#/mypreferencesmenu), which the user menu's Settings
//     and the legacy layouts' user button open, in a section of its own
//     before the user section (.userSection).
// The legacy layouts are Desktop (Legacy), Mobile (Legacy) and TV. The
// default layout's side menu has no Dashboard. It is a plain link:
// jellyfin-web's emby-linkbutton would route it within jellyfin-web. The
// script asks jellyfin-web's client (ApiClient.getCurrentUser) whether the
// user is an administrator whenever the user signed in changes, as for the
// seventh, and keeps the last member in the browser's storage, so that the
// entry shows as soon as jellyfin-web draws a menu. A MutationObserver on
// the page puts it back as jellyfin-web draws its menus anew. It never shows
// where Dashboard shows, nor before sign-in, and goes as soon as the user
// signed in is another, signing out included. Any error just stops it.
//
// Ninth, on a title's page, it shows the title's three scores in the first
// line of its details (.itemMiscInfo-primary): its IMDb rating, its
// critics' score and its audience score, labelled, as
// /Polyfin/Items/{id}/Ratings answers them while the server has an MDBList
// key for ratings (Settings › Content). jellyfin-web shows only
// CommunityRating, with a star, and CriticRating, with its own icon: the
// script hides both in that line while its scores show, and gives them back
// as the route leaves the title. The answer may come while MDBList is
// asked about the title (Pending): it asks again 3 seconds later, 10 times
// at most. A MutationObserver on the page puts the scores back as
// jellyfin-web renders the line anew. An answer without a score, or no
// answer, changes nothing; nor does anything during a video. Its words
// follow jellyfin-web's language, as for the third. Any error just stops
// it.
//
// Tenth, it adds Polyfin's own entries to jellyfin-web's item menu, the
// action sheet a card's ⋮ button or a right click on a card opens, and the
// ⋮ button of a title's page (.btnMoreCommands):
//   "Remove from Continue Watching", for a card of a Continue Watching row:
//     a row whose cards all have a resume point, as /UserItems/Resume
//     lists them, the libraries' own rows included. It deletes
//     /Polyfin/UserItems/{id}/Resume and takes the card off the row;
//   "Hide this title", for a movie, a home video or a series, or a season
//     or an episode of one, that the user has not hidden, as
//     /Polyfin/UserItems/Hidden lists them. It posts to
//     /Polyfin/UserItems/{id}/Hidden, takes the cards of the title off the
//     page and says so in a toast, as jellyfin-web's own;
//   "Show this title again", in its place for a title the user hid, its
//     series hidden counting for a season or an episode, which deletes
//     /Polyfin/UserItems/{id}/Hidden.
// As the button is pressed or the card right-clicked, before jellyfin-web
// opens its menu, the script asks for the item (ApiClient.getItem), the
// hidden titles and, for a card with a resume point, Continue Watching;
// the first action sheet that opens within 10 seconds, no other click
// coming between, gets the entries once the answers come. An entry closes
// the menu as Back does, then acts. jellyfin-web 12.2 keeps the answers of
// its rows for a minute, in memory and in the browser's IndexedDB, and
// draws a row from such an answer, asking nothing, when the change's
// UserDataChanged message refreshes it or when the page loads again within
// that minute. The script keeps what its entries took off in the
// browser's session storage, for the server and user, for 2 minutes, and
// has every row's answers (their fetchData) leave out, meanwhile, the item
// taken off Continue Watching from rows whose items all resume, unless
// played since its last play then, and the titles hidden, with what is in
// them, from every row. Nothing is kept longer: an older answer is asked
// again, and Polyfin's leaves them out. Its words follow jellyfin-web's
// language, as the third's. Any error just stops it.
//
// Eleventh, it adds to jellyfin-web's home page the rows the administrator
// chose under Settings › Web player › Home rows, as
// /Polyfin/HomeRows answers them for the user signed in: each with its
// Name, its Place and its first Items, the rows the user turned off, or
// without a title, left out. Each time the home page shows (#/home, its
// .homeSectionsContainer in a page that is not hidden), it asks again,
// with the user's home sections, as jellyfin-web reads them from the
// display preferences "usersettings" of the client "emby" (homesection0 to
// homesection9, jellyfin-web's defaults for those not set, the TV layout
// starting with the library tiles when they lack); then it puts each row
// at its place, in the answer's order: Top before the first section,
// AfterResume after the section of Continue Watching (resume), AfterNextUp
// after Next Up's (nextup), Bottom after the last; a row after a section
// the user's home page does not show takes the place before. jellyfin-web
// fills the sections .section0 to .section9 it made first, in place: the
// rows go between them. A row is drawn as jellyfin-web draws a library's
// row of latest items, with its classes, so that its styles, scroll
// buttons and item actions apply: the row's name opens its list
// (#/list?parentId= the row's Id), each card a poster with the title's
// played mark, or count of unplayed episodes, and progress, opening the
// title's page. When jellyfin-web draws the home page anew, which empties
// it, a MutationObserver on the page puts the rows back from the last
// answer. Every time it draws them, it leaves out the titles the item
// menus hid meanwhile, as the tenth keeps them in the session storage for
// the user signed in (a series taking its items with it), and a row left
// without a title. Nothing else changes, nor anything while the answer is awaited.
// Any error just stops it.
//
// Twelfth, on a movie's or an episode's page, it adds a "Share" button to
// the page's buttons (.mainDetailButtons), before its ⋮ button
// (.btnMoreCommands), drawn as jellyfin-web draws them, for a user who may
// give the title through a share link. As the route opens a title, it asks
// /Polyfin/Items/{id}/Share, which answers Shareable true when the server
// allows share links (Settings › Security › Allow share links), the user
// may share titles, and the title is a movie or an episode they see, with
// Url, the admin app's My account › Shared links with the title chosen.
// The button opens that address in the same tab, where the admin app signs
// the user in with the web client's token, as for the eighth. It asks every
// second until jellyfin-web made its client, 10 times at most. A
// MutationObserver on the page puts the button back as jellyfin-web renders
// the page anew; nothing changes during a video, and the button goes as the
// route leaves the title. Its word follows jellyfin-web's language, as for
// the third. Any error just stops it.
//
// Thirteenth, on the page of a Live TV programme that has not started, it
// adds Polyfin's reminders after the record buttons (.recordingFields,
// which jellyfin-web draws on every title page and fills for programmes):
// "Remind me", which has Polyfin tell the user, on their own notification
// targets, a few minutes before the programme starts, and a menu button
// whose menu offers "Remind me of every airing": the programmes of the
// same title on the same channel at the same time of day, within ten
// minutes, as a series timer finds them. A programme with a reminder shows
// "Reminder set" instead, which removes it, or the series reminder that
// made it: a line under the button then tells every airing at about which
// time. When no target of the user chose Programme starting, and their
// apps do not show reminders, a line says so, with a link to My account ›
// Notifications in the admin app. Jellyfin has no reminder: the script asks
// Polyfin's /Polyfin/Reminders/Programs/{id}, which answers how the
// programme stands, and nothing useful for an item that is not a programme
// of the user's guide or for a user without Live TV, who get no button; it
// posts to /Polyfin/Reminders to set one, with the page's language, which
// the message is written in, and deletes /Polyfin/Reminders/{id} to remove
// one. It asks once jellyfin-web has drawn the page's recording fields,
// and a MutationObserver puts the buttons back as jellyfin-web renders the
// page anew. Its words follow jellyfin-web's language, as the third's. It
// never changes the page during a video, and takes the buttons off as the
// route leaves the programme. Any error just stops it.
//
// Fifteenth, in the video player (#/video), it adds a button after the
// subtitle button of the controls (.videoOsdBottom .btnSubtitles) that
// opens a panel with three rows: the subtitles' size, from 50% to 300%;
// how high they sit, raised by up to 30% of the screen's height; and their
// timing, earlier or later by tenths and halves of a second. Size and
// height are kept in the browser's local storage and apply to every video,
// through a stylesheet: the subtitles jellyfin-web draws itself
// (.videoSubtitlesInner) are scaled from their bottom and raised, those the
// browser draws (::cue) take the size only. Timing is jellyfin-web's own
// subtitle offset, which it resets for each video: the panel moves the
// slider of jellyfin-web's subtitle sync (.subtitleSyncSlider, which
// jellyfin-web makes once a video with subtitles plays) through its
// updateOffset, as jellyfin-web's own G and H keys do; with no subtitle
// shown, the row says to pick one. Keys pressed in the panel stay in it.
// The panel closes on its button, on Escape, and as the route leaves the
// player. Its words follow jellyfin-web's language, as the third's. Any
// error just stops it.
