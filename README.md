> [!NOTE]
> **This fork** adds to Polyfin:
> - **Rip exclusion list** (Settings › Playback): CAM, telesync, telecine, screener and workprint releases are removed from every title, each type toggled on its own, all on by default.
> - **NostalgiaTV and other live-TV apps:** library-wide episode listings (`/Items?IncludeItemTypes=Episode&Recursive=true`, with or without a library, narrowed by `Genres`/`GenreIds`) and `/Genres` without a library, answered from a pool of each TV library's first 40 series, ported from AIOFin.
> - **Hide specials** toggle (Settings › Playback): season 0 left out of seasons, episode lists and Next Up, on by default.
> - **AIOStreams look** for the web player (jellyfin-web, themed by its default Custom CSS: near-black pages, white pill buttons, rounded cards, Inter), with **Plex-style subtitles**.
> - **Wide collections:** an addon's collection with a landscape poster (`posterShape`), such as streaming-service tiles, shows on wide cards on the home page and in its library.
> - **Docker image on GitHub:** every push to `main` publishes `ghcr.io/<owner>/polyfin` (see `.github/workflows/docker.yml`). Set `POLYFIN_IMAGE` in `.env` and run `docker compose up -d`.

Polyfin is a self-hosted server that speaks the Jellyfin API. Its content comes from:
- **Stremio addons:** catalogs, metadata, streams and subtitles;
- **Eclipse music addons:** music, audiobooks and podcasts;
- **IPTV sources:** M3U playlists and Xtream Codes accounts, with XMLTV guides.

Any Jellyfin app connects to it like a regular Jellyfin server, with real user accounts and transcoding, and without Jellyfin installed.

See it on the [website](https://moodiness.github.io/polyfin/): the ad above, a short tour, a video for each feature, and the documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> Polyfin is in early development. Expect changes between releases, and report problems in the [issues](https://github.com/moodiness/polyfin/issues).

## Features

- **Works with Jellyfin apps:** sign in with a password or Quick Connect, then browse, search and play. Polyfin targets the Jellyfin 12.4 API.
- **Stremio addons as libraries:** catalogs become libraries and collections, and streams become versions of a title.
- **Live TV and IPTV:** TV catalogs, M3U playlists and Xtream Codes accounts become Live TV, with a programme guide and recordings. IPTV providers' archives of past programmes play from a Replay view. IPTV movies and series become libraries.
- **Music, audiobooks and podcasts:** Eclipse music addons install like Stremio addons and become music and books libraries. Tracks play as they are, or are converted when the app needs it.
- **Playback and transcoding:** direct play when the app supports the file. Otherwise a remux or a conversion to HLS, on an NVIDIA, AMD or Intel GPU, or VideoToolbox on macOS, when there is one, with HDR tone mapped on NVIDIA and Intel GPUs and VideoToolbox, else on the processor.
- **Subtitles:** only the tracks inside the files, ASS styles with their fonts included. Image subtitles are burned in when an app cannot show them.
- **Multiple users:** each user has their own watched state, resume points, favorites and Next Up, with parental control and per-user limits. Invite links let people create their own account.
- **Skip buttons:** intros, recaps, credits and previews to skip, from three community databases.
- **Tracking:** each user can send what they watch to Trakt, Simkl, MDBList and PublicMetaDB, and import what they watched there, or in their Stremio or Nuvio account.
- **Built in:** Jellyfin's own web client at `/web/`, and an admin app at `/admin/`.

## How it works

```text
Jellyfin client ──Jellyfin API──> Polyfin ──Stremio protocol──> metadata and stream addons
      │                              │
      │ direct play: 302 ────────────┼──────────────> debrid / provider URL
      │                              │
      └── transcoding: HLS <── FFmpeg (reads the stream through Polyfin's cache, serves the segments)
```

Polyfin always handles authentication, accounts, browsing, metadata, source selection and playback state.

It reads the remote stream itself only in these cases:
- when it transcodes;
- to relay a source the app could not reach (one that needs request headers, or is on a local network address);
- to relay a redirect the app could not follow.

So whether a title plays directly or is transcoded decides how much bandwidth the server uses. Apps never see the addons' stream URLs: they receive Polyfin's own, signed for the user.

## Compatible clients

Polyfin targets the apps that connect to a Jellyfin server, including Infuse, Swiftfin, Findroid, Streamyfin, Nuvio, Strand, Odin, VidHub, the official Jellyfin apps and Kodi. See [Jellyfin compatibility](docs/jellyfin-compatibility.md).

## Quick start (Docker)

Requirements: Docker with Compose v2. The image, `ghcr.io/moodiness/polyfin`, is published for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/moodiness/polyfin.git
cd polyfin
cp .env.example .env    # then set POSTGRES_PASSWORD, e.g. openssl rand -hex 24
docker compose up -d
```

1. Open `http://<server>:8096/admin/`.
2. Enter the one-time setup code from the log (`docker compose logs polyfin`) to create the administrator.
3. Continue with [Getting started](docs/getting-started.md).

Without Docker, [Polyfin Desktop](docs/desktop.md) runs Polyfin on Windows, macOS or Linux, with its own database, from an icon in the tray: each release has an installer for Windows, x64 or arm64, a disk image for macOS, and a `.deb` and an AppImage for Linux.

[Installation](docs/installation.md) covers:
- pinning a version;
- building the image from source;
- the Unraid template;
- giving the container a GPU;
- the health check, and monitoring addresses;
- daily database backups.

## Configuration

With the Compose file, the only value you must set is `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in `.env`, and `POLYFIN_SECRET_KEY` is advised. Every option is set in the admin app, under **Settings**. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md).
