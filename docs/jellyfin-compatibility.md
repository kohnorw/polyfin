# Jellyfin compatibility

Polyfin targets the Jellyfin 12.2 API, so standard Jellyfin apps sign in, browse, search and play. This page lists the compatible apps, what they get from Polyfin, and the Jellyfin features Polyfin does without.

## Compatible apps

Polyfin targets the apps that connect to a Jellyfin server, including:

- Infuse
- Swiftfin
- Findroid
- Streamyfin
- Nuvio
- Strand
- Odin
- VidHub
- Official Jellyfin apps
- Kodi

Apps reach Polyfin at its address, such as `http://192.168.1.10:8096`, and also under `/jellyfin` at that address, such as `http://192.168.1.10:8096/jellyfin`, where a Jellyfin server behind a reverse proxy often lives: given an address without a path, some apps try it there first. Under `/jellyfin`, in any letter case, the Jellyfin API, its WebSocket at `/jellyfin/socket` and the web client at `/jellyfin/web/` answer as at the root. The admin app, `/healthz` and `/readyz` are at the root only.

## What apps get

Jellyfin apps get the rest of what they ask a movie, series and Live TV server for.

### Title pages

A title's page opens as soon as its description is ready, with the versions Polyfin already knows, even from lists that expired, while it asks the stream addons without a current list in the background. The web player adds their versions as each addon answers. Other apps show the versions known when the page opened, and get them all when the user presses Play or opens the page again. See [Title pages](playback.md#title-pages).

**For app developers:** `/Polyfin/Items/{id}/Versions` tells how many addons are still asked, for the first time or again, how many media sources the title's details list now, how many versions are known, and whether the web player adds versions to a page already open (`AddVersions`), and Polyfin pushes the same as a `PolyfinVersions` message as it changes, on the live connection (WebSocket) of jellyfin-web only, the app signed in as `Jellyfin Web`: other apps get Jellyfin's own message types alone, as the Jellyfin SDKs some apps are built on fail on a type they do not know. `POST /Polyfin/Items/{id}/Versions/Search` has the title's addons asked again, once every 20 seconds at most for a user's title (see [Title pages](playback.md#title-pages)).

### Ratings

With the server's **MDBList API key for ratings**, `CommunityRating` carries a movie's or series' IMDb rating from MDBList (0 to 10) and `CriticRating` its critics' score or audience score (0 to 100), as **Critic rating shows** chooses; an administrator's edit still wins. Listings that fit on one page, addons' collections read whole among them, sort by `SortBy=CriticRating` as by `CommunityRating`, titles without one first. The Watchlist and smart lists keep their own order (see [Smart lists](addons-and-libraries.md#smart-lists)). See [Ratings](addons-and-libraries.md#ratings).

**For app developers:** `/Polyfin/Items/{id}/Ratings` answers a title's `CommunityRating`, `CriticsScore` and `AudienceScore` (null when it has none, all null without a key) and `Pending` while MDBList is being asked about it.

### Volume between songs

With **Even the volume between songs** on, the default, songs (`Audio`) and albums (`MusicAlbum`) carry `NormalizationGain`, in dB relative to -18 LUFS, in listings and details, once it is known, as on Jellyfin 10.9 and later: the ReplayGain tags of local songs, else their measured loudness (see [Volume between songs](addons-and-libraries.md#volume-between-songs)). The stream itself is not changed: apps apply the gain, the song's or the album's as their playback settings choose, and an app that ignores it plays as before. The web player takes a song's from the list it plays from, and its album's from the album's details. Music libraries' `LibraryOptions` report `EnableLUFSScan` as measuring is set for their songs. Off, no item carries a gain and nothing is measured.

### Libraries left out of the web player menus

On the admin app's **Libraries** page, an administrator can leave any of the server's libraries out of the web player's menus, and each user any of their own: its top bar, the bar's **More** menu and its side menu. The library keeps its row on the home screen, and other apps keep listing it. Live TV catalogs have no such option: their channels go to Live TV.

**For app developers:** `GET /Polyfin/UserViews` lists the views `/UserViews` gives the caller, in the same order, as `{"Items": [{"Id": <the view's Id>, "HideInMenus": <true when the web player's menus leave it out>}]}`. Polyfin's own Live TV, Playlists, Collections and Watchlist views are never left out.

### Continue Watching and hidden titles

Jellyfin apps have no button to take a title off Continue Watching without marking it played or unplayed, nor to hide a title from one's lists. The web player gets both in its ⋮ menus, and the admin app's **My account** lists both for the other apps (see [Watch state](users.md#watch-state)). Apps see the result at their next refresh: the title is gone from `/UserItems/Resume`, and a hidden title from every listing; it still opens by its identifier. Apps that keep the live connection (WebSocket) open are told of a `UserDataChanged` for the item, as for any other change.

**For app developers:** `DELETE /Polyfin/UserItems/{id}/Resume` takes the item off Continue Watching, a series or a season its episodes, and answers its `UserItemData`. `POST /Polyfin/UserItems/{id}/Hidden` hides a movie, a home video or a series, a season or an episode standing for its series, and `DELETE` shows it again; both answer 204. `GET /Polyfin/UserItems/Hidden` lists the hidden titles, the latest hidden first, as a listing describes them.

### Profile pictures

A user changes their own profile picture from their app; an administrator can change anyone's.

- Polyfin accepts a JPEG, PNG or WebP picture of up to 5 MB and keeps it in the database.
- It is scaled down to 512 pixels and stored as JPEG, or PNG when it is transparent.
- It shows in users, sign-in screens and sessions, and on the admin app's **Users** page.

**For app developers:** `/UserImage`, and the older `/Users/{id}/Images/{type}`.

### Search hints

Search hints answer from the same search as the main item search, in this order:

1. the movies and series the addons find;
2. the episodes Polyfin knows by name from series already opened (addons search titles, not episodes);
3. the people credited in titles the user reaches.

All results stay within the user's libraries, parental control and blocked genres. Channels and programmes, which the item search also finds (see [Searching](live-tv.md#searching)), are left out of search hints.

**Compared with Jellyfin:**

- Jellyfin ranks every kind together; Polyfin keeps the order above.

**For app developers:** `/Search/Hints` answers from the same search as `/Items`, without its channels and programmes.

### Movie recommendations

For each of the last movies the user played, recommendations give the "Because you watched" titles similar to it. They come from the similar titles of title pages, without those already played. With **Similar titles** off there are none.

**Compared with Jellyfin:**

- Jellyfin's categories for liked titles and for the people of recent movies are left out: each would cost a search of the addons.

**For app developers:** `/Movies/Recommendations`.

### Years, groupings, artwork and viewing

**For app developers:**

- `/Years` lists the years the year pages offer (catalogs whose genre filter offers years).
- `/UserViews/GroupingOptions` lists the movie and series libraries.
- `/Items/{id}/Images` lists a title's artwork.
- `/Sessions/Viewing` records the item an app shows, which **Sessions** gives as `NowViewingItem`.

### Remote images

jellyfin-web's **Edit images** searches TMDB, while the server has a **TMDB API key**, and the server's metadata addons for an item's images, and keeps the one an administrator downloads as an upload. See [Edit images](addons-and-libraries.md#edit-images).

**For app developers:**

- `/Items/{id}/RemoteImages/Providers` lists `TMDB` and `Addons` with their `SupportedImages`: both for movies and series, `TMDB` alone (Primary) for seasons, episodes and people, none for other items or without a key.
- `/Items/{id}/RemoteImages` answers a `RemoteImageResult` for `type` (every type when left out), `providerName`, `includeAllLanguages`, `startIndex` and `limit`. An addon's image has its addon's name as `ProviderName`. `Url` and `ThumbnailUrl` are Polyfin addresses, signed for the item, which apps load without credentials.
- `POST /Items/{id}/RemoteImages/Download?type=&imageUrl=` is for administrators (403 otherwise). `imageUrl` must be a `Url` Polyfin listed for the item and type (400 otherwise); `providerName` is ignored.

### Trailers, channels and theme media

Trailer items and plugin channels answer empty lists, as on a Jellyfin server without them. Addons give trailers only with their titles, as `RemoteTrailers`.

The extras, local trailers and theme media local folders keep beside their titles are served as Jellyfin serves them (see [Extras and theme media](local-folders.md#extras-and-theme-media)): each is a `Video` item, or `Audio` for a theme song, with its `ExtraType` (`Trailer`, `BehindTheScenes`, `DeletedScene`, `Interview`, `Scene`, `Sample`, `Short`, `Featurette`, `Clip`, `Unknown`, `ThemeSong` or `ThemeVideo`) and its title, or season, as `ParentId`. No listing holds them; they play, with their own user data, as the title's local versions do.

**For app developers:**

- `/Items/{id}/LocalTrailers` lists a movie's, series' or season's local trailers, and `/Items/{id}/SpecialFeatures` its other extras, theme media left out, both as arrays of items; the `/Users/{userId}/Items/{id}/…` forms jellyfin-web calls answer the same.
- `/Items/{id}/ThemeSongs` and `/Items/{id}/ThemeVideos` answer a `ThemeMediaResult`, and `/Items/{id}/ThemeMedia` both, with no soundtrack songs. With `inheritFromParent=true`, a season without any gets its series', and an episode its season's, else its series'; `OwnerId` is the item they were found on. `sortBy=Random` shuffles them.
- An item's details give `LocalTrailerCount` and `SpecialFeatureCount`; `RemoteTrailers` stay the addons' trailers.

### Opening streams and downloading files

Sources need no opening. A title's file download serves its first working version, as the download route does, under the same permissions. Apps that download through PlaybackInfo with a device profile asking for video converted progressively (`Protocol` `http`), as Streamyfin does, get a `TranscodingUrl` at `/videos/{id}/stream.mp4` when **Converted downloads** is on. See [Converted downloads](transcoding.md#converted-downloads).

**Compared with Jellyfin:**

- Jellyfin does not ask for these permissions for its own files.

**For app developers:**

- `/LiveStreams/Open` answers 400, as Jellyfin does without an open token; `/LiveStreams/Close` answers 204.
- `/Items/{id}/File` serves the first working version.
- `/Videos/{id}/stream.mp4` and `/Videos/{id}/stream.ts` convert only for the `TranscodingUrl` of a converted download: with `static=true`, or without a play session and a `videoCodec`, or with **Converted downloads** off, they serve the version as it is, as before.

### Fallback fonts

Fallback fonts are the fonts in `POLYFIN_FONTS_DIR`, folders within included. The image ships DejaVu (Latin, Greek and Cyrillic). Mount more fonts there for other scripts, for example CJK.

**Compared with Jellyfin:**

- Jellyfin reads only the top of its folder.

**For app developers:** `/FallbackFont/Fonts`.

### Subtitle files

Polyfin offers only the subtitle tracks inside the files (see [subtitles](subtitles.md)). Uploads are refused, and the subtitle search finds nothing.

**For app developers:**

- Add: `POST /Videos/{id}/Subtitles` answers 403.
- `GET /Items/{id}/RemoteSearch/Subtitles/{language}` answers an empty list.

### Picture subtitles drawn by the app

When jellyfin-web is set to draw PGS subtitles itself, a PGS track inside a Matroska file reaches it as a SUP file, as Jellyfin 12.2 serves its raw file. Polyfin reads the track whole through the file's index, as it does for text tracks, and keeps it for later playbacks. The app reads the file by ranges as it plays.

- A track the index does not list block by block, or larger than 32 MB, is not offered as a file.
- DVD (VobSub) tracks are not offered as files: they are burned in.

**For app developers:** `GET /Videos/{id}/{mediaSourceId}/Subtitles/{index}/0/Stream.pgssub` (or `.sup`) answers `application/octet-stream` and supports `Range`.

### Jellyfin 12.2 details

- **Codec tags:** each track's `CodecTag` is the tag ffprobe reads, such as `avc1` or `mp4a` in MP4. Matroska's empty tags are left out, and live channels report none. Attached files report theirs as they are, `[0][0][0][0]` in Matroska. Direct play checks a profile's `VideoCodecTag` conditions against the file's tag.
- **Rewatching:** starting a played movie, episode or audiobook again does not change its last played date. The date changes once the position passes the start, or when the title is played to the end. Next Up therefore does not move past an episode that was only just started.
- **Letter filters:** `nameStartsWith`, `nameLessThan` and `nameStartsWithOrGreater` ignore letter case. They narrow people, music, favorites and other personal lists, and playlists. Movie and series libraries come from addons' catalogs, so they are not narrowed.
- **People counts:** `/Persons` counts only the people it can list.
- **Downmix:** music and audiobooks converted to stereo go through the downmix chosen in the server settings, as the audio of converted video does.

### Refresh metadata

**Refresh metadata** (administrators only) makes Polyfin forget the title's description, version and subtitle lists, expired ones included, the rating it looked up and its ratings from MDBList, and stop asking addons again for those lists. It then asks the addons for the description again at once.

**For app developers:** `POST /Items/{id}/Refresh`.

### Administration from Jellyfin apps

API keys, devices, user management, server configuration, the activity log, logs and scheduled tasks are covered in [administration](administration.md#api-keys-and-integrations).

### Signing in to apps with Quick Connect

Jellyfin apps ask for a name and a password, never for a code. An account with [two-step sign-in](users.md#two-step-sign-in), and an administrator while **Require two-step sign-in for administrators** is on, signs in to them with Quick Connect:

1. In the app, choose Quick Connect on the sign-in screen: it shows a 6-digit code.
2. Sign in to the admin app, with the password and the code of your authenticator app, and enter the app's code on the **Quick Connect** page: in the top bar for members, in the account menu for administrators.
3. The app signs in as you.

Quick Connect must stay on, under **Settings › General**. Typing the password in the app is refused as a wrong password is, and counts as one toward the client's failed attempts, so that the answer never tells whether the password was right. The apps signed in before two-step sign-in was turned on stay signed in; sign them out under **My account › Devices** if needed. API keys made by administrators work as before.

**Compared with Jellyfin:**

- Jellyfin has no second step of its own. Polyfin keeps Jellyfin's sign-in as it is for the apps, and asks for the code in the admin app only.

**For app developers:** `/Users/AuthenticateByName` answers 401 for such an account, as for a wrong password; `/Users/AuthenticateWithQuickConnect` signs it in once a request is approved.

### Client addresses behind a reverse proxy

Like Jellyfin's own Known proxies setting, **Known proxies**, under **Settings › Security**, lists the reverse proxies whose forwarded headers name the client of a request. See [Known proxies](reverse-proxy.md#known-proxies).

**For app developers:** a session's `RemoteEndPoint`, and `IsLocal` and `IsInNetwork` of `/System/Endpoint`, follow the client's address: the one the proxy names for a request from a known proxy, the connection's otherwise.

### Finding servers on the local network

Jellyfin apps that look for servers on the local network list Polyfin, as they list a Jellyfin server with its auto discovery on: its address does not have to be typed. **Answer local network discovery**, under **Settings › General**, is on by default, as Jellyfin's is, and **Address on the local network** plays the part of Jellyfin's `PublishedServerUrl`. In Docker, the container's network decides whether the apps' messages reach Polyfin: see [Let apps find Polyfin on the local network](installation.md#let-apps-find-polyfin-on-the-local-network) and [Local network discovery](administration.md#local-network-discovery).

**For app developers:**

- Polyfin listens on UDP port 7359, IPv4 and IPv6. A datagram that holds `who is JellyfinServer?`, in any letter case, as Jellyfin 12.2 reads it, gets one answer, sent to its sender: `{"Address":"http://192.168.1.10:8096","Id":"<server ID>","Name":"<server name>","EndpointAddress":null}`. Polyfin answers Emby's `who is EmbyServer?` the same way, which Jellyfin 12.2 leaves unanswered.
- `Id` and `Name` are those of `/System/Info/Public`. `Address` is **Address on the local network** when set, as Jellyfin's `PublishedServerUrl`. Otherwise it is `http://`, the address of the server's interface that reaches the sender, and Polyfin's HTTP port.
- Only senders on the local network are answered: private IPv4 ranges, IPv6 unique local addresses, link-local addresses and loopback. Jellyfin answers any sender.
- `LocalAddress` of `/System/Info/Public` and `/System/Info` is **Address on the local network** when set, as Jellyfin gives its `PublishedServerUrl` there, and otherwise the address the request reached: over the HTTPS Polyfin serves itself, `https://` and the HTTPS port included (see [HTTPS](administration.md#https)).
- While Polyfin serves HTTPS, discovery answers keep the HTTP address: a certificate for a public name does not match the server's address on the local network, and HTTP is never redirected there. Jellyfin, too, announces its HTTP address unless `PublishedServerUrl` says otherwise. To announce HTTPS, set **Address on the local network** to an `https://` address whose name the certificate holds.

### DLNA devices

TVs and players that play over DLNA, without a Jellyfin app, browse and play the libraries of the user an administrator chose for each (see [DLNA](dlna.md)). Their playbacks show in the web client's dashboard and in `/Sessions` like an app's, with the app named `DLNA` and the device's name; Polyfin cannot control them.

**For app developers:**

- A DLNA playback is listed in `/Sessions` under its user, with `Client` `DLNA`, `DeviceName` the device's name, `DeviceId` `dlna-` and the device's ID, `RemoteEndPoint` its address, `NowPlayingItem` and `PlayState`, until two minutes after the device last asked for anything. `SupportsRemoteControl` and `SupportsMediaControl` are false, and a listing with `controllableByUserId` leaves it out.
- `PositionTicks` is how far the device read, as Polyfin infers it: devices report nothing. For a file sent as it is, that is the share of the file's bytes sent during the playback, wherever they are in it. A DLNA playback counts against the user's **Playbacks at once**, as an app's does.

### Live TV tuners

The server's HDHomeRun tuners (see [HDHomeRun tuners](iptv.md#hdhomerun-tuners)) are Jellyfin's tuner hosts of type `hdhomerun`. Their channels are listed with the others in Live TV. jellyfin-web's tuner pages open the tuner's page in the admin app, or **Add a source** on its **HDHomeRun tuner** tab for a new tuner (see [Dashboard links and single sign-on](web-client.md#dashboard-links-and-single-sign-on)).

**For app developers:**

- `/LiveTv/TunerHosts/Types` lists HDHomeRun (`hdhomerun`), as Jellyfin names it; M3U tuners are not offered, as IPTV sources are added in the admin app.
- `/LiveTv/Tuners/Discover` (and Jellyfin's `/LiveTv/Tuners/Discvover`) lists the tuners that answer discovery, as Jellyfin's `TunerHostInfo`: `Type`, `Url`, `DeviceId`, `FriendlyName`, `TunerCount`, without an `Id`. With `newDevicesOnly=true`, those already added are left out. Administrators only.
- `POST /LiveTv/TunerHosts` adds a tuner from its `Url`, with `ImportFavoritesOnly`, and answers it with its `Id`; with the `Id` of a tuner, it changes its address and `ImportFavoritesOnly`. The tuner is read first: one that does not answer is refused (500), and so is one already added (400). Another `Type` answers 404, as in Jellyfin. Administrators only.
- `DELETE /LiveTv/TunerHosts?id=` removes the tuner, and answers 204 for an identifier that is not a tuner's, as Jellyfin does, leaving other IPTV sources be.
- `/System/Configuration/livetv` is Jellyfin's `LiveTvOptions`: the recordings' paddings in `PrePaddingSeconds` and `PostPaddingSeconds`, and, to administrators, the recordings folder in `RecordingPath` (null while recording is off) and the tuners in `TunerHosts`; its other settings are Jellyfin's defaults. A member gets no folder or tuner there, as they are of the server's own disk and local network. Polyfin's recording and guide settings are changed in the admin app (see [Live TV](live-tv.md)), not through this route.
- Settings Polyfin's tuners do not have take Jellyfin's defaults: `AllowStreamSharing` is true, as a channel's stream is always shared between its viewers.

### Backups

The backups page of the web client's dashboard, since Jellyfin 10.11, shows the database backups of the backups folder (see [Backups](backups.md)): it lists them, makes one, and restores one. Polyfin's backups hold its database alone, whatever the options asked: Jellyfin's also hold its metadata, trickplay images and subtitles, which Polyfin does not keep on disk.

**For app developers:**

- Administrators only, as in Jellyfin. While backups are off, `/Backup` lists nothing, `/Backup/Create` answers 403, and `/Backup/Restore` answers 404.
- `GET /Backup` lists the backups of the folder, newest first, as `BackupManifestDto`: `DateCreated` (when the backup was made), `Path` (the file name, such as `polyfin-20261005-040000.dump`; Jellyfin gives the archive's full path), `ServerVersion` (the Jellyfin version of `/System/Info`), `BackupEngineVersion` (`1.0.0`, Polyfin's format), and `Options` with only `Database` true. The backups made before a restore are listed too.
- `POST /Backup/Create` runs **Back up the database** at once, sends the backup to the destinations, and answers its manifest. The options of the body are ignored.
- `GET /Backup/Manifest?path=` answers the manifest of the backup of the folder named `path`, and 404 for any other path.
- `POST /Backup/Restore` with `ArchiveFileName`, a file name `/Backup` lists, restores it as the admin app does, and answers 204: Polyfin backs the current database up, stops, restores it and starts again, answering 503 meanwhile. It answers 404 for a backup the folder does not have, and 400 for a file that is not a backup of Polyfin's database, a backup of a newer Polyfin, a server without `pg_restore`, a restore already under way, and a backup holding stored keys the current `POLYFIN_SECRET_KEY` cannot decrypt, as apps cannot show that warning: the admin app restores those.

## Jellyfin features Polyfin does without

These dashboard features answer as a Jellyfin 12.2 on which nothing of the kind is configured:

- plugins, packages and plugin repositories;
- browsing the server's folders;
- library folders and metadata providers;
- Live TV listing providers;
- the startup wizard.

Polyfin never shows the host's folders. To change the server's settings, use the [admin app](administration.md#settings) or the server configuration API.

**For app developers:**

- Answers go to administrators only where Jellyfin requires one.
- `/Plugins`, `/Packages`, `/Repositories`, `/Environment/Drives`, `/Environment/DirectoryContents` and `/Library/PhysicalPaths` list nothing.
- `/Libraries/AvailableOptions` lists no provider (Jellyfin also lists its own, its NFO reader and saver among them).
- `/System/Configuration/MetadataOptions/Default` and `/LiveTv/ListingProviders/Default` are Jellyfin's defaults.
- `/Startup/Configuration` and `/Startup/User` show the server name, language and earliest administrator; setup is always complete.
- Writes are refused as Jellyfin refuses them for what does not exist (an unknown plugin or package, path, or listing provider).
- Writes Jellyfin would perform answer 403: saving plugin repositories, and the wizard's configuration, remote access and first user. Change server settings through `/System/Configuration` instead.
- `/Environment/ValidatePath` answers 404 for every path.
