# Local folders

Polyfin serves your own video files beside what addons and IPTV sources provide. An administrator declares folders mounted in Polyfin's container, or network shares Polyfin reads itself; each file is matched to a title and becomes one more version of it, next to the addons' streams, with the same version picker, subtitles, audio tracks and transcoding. Each folder is also a library apps see, listing the titles found in it. A folder may also hold music, see [Music folders](#music-folders), or videos no metadata addon knows, see [Home videos](#home-videos).

Folders on a NAS or another computer can be mounted on the host and declared as local folders, or read by Polyfin over SMB or WebDAV, from an S3-compatible bucket, an SFTP server or an rclone remote, with no mount: see [network shares](#network-shares).

## Mounting folders

Mount each folder in the container, read-only is enough. With Docker:

```sh
docker run … -v /srv/media/movies:/media/movies:ro -v /srv/media/shows:/media/shows:ro ghcr.io/moodiness/polyfin:latest
```

With compose, add the volumes to the `polyfin` service:

```yaml
  polyfin:
    volumes:
      - polyfin_data:/data
      - /srv/media/movies:/media/movies:ro
      - /srv/media/shows:/media/shows:ro
```

Then, in the admin app, open **Sources**, choose **Add a source › Folder**, keep **Local folder**, and give its name (the library's name in apps), its path in the container (`/media/movies`, not the host's path), and whether it holds movies or shows. What a folder holds can change afterwards (see [Changing what a folder holds](#changing-what-a-folder-holds)).

### On Windows and macOS

Outside Docker, as with the desktop version, there is nothing to mount: a local folder is a folder of the computer Polyfin runs on, by its full path, which the admin app's form names for the system Polyfin runs on. It learns that system from `GET /admin/api/status`, whose `system` is `container` in a container, else `linux`, `macos` or `windows`.

- **Windows:** a drive's folder, `D:\Movies`, or a share's, `\\nas\media\Movies`, with backslashes or slashes, in any letter case. A drive's root, such as `E:\` for a disk of movies, may be one; the system's drive, `C:\`, may not, as `/` may not elsewhere. A mapped network drive exists only in the session that mapped it: give the share's path rather than its letter. The folders Windows makes at a drive's root, `$RECYCLE.BIN` and `System Volume Information`, are left out, everywhere.
- **macOS:** a full path, such as `/Users/me/Movies`; an external disk's folders are under `/Volumes`, such as `/Volumes/Media/Movies`. macOS asks once whether Polyfin may read the folders of Desktop, Documents, Downloads and removable disks: allow it, or **Health** reports such a folder as `unreadable`.

Everything else works as in Docker: names, NFO and subtitle files beside the videos, discs and images, links, scans and [watching for changes](#watching-for-changes). An M3U playlist of a music folder may name its tracks by their Windows paths, `D:\Music\…`, or `file:///D:/Music/…` addresses, in any letter case.

### Permissions

Polyfin runs as user 65532 (group 65532). It must be able to read every file and to open every folder under the path: on the host, files need the "read" permission and folders "read" and "execute" for that user, its group or everyone, such as `chmod -R a+rX /srv/media`. Polyfin never writes to these folders. Outside Docker, Polyfin reads the folders as the account it runs as, such as yours with the desktop version.

A folder Polyfin cannot read is reported on its page in the admin app and under **System › Health**:

- the path does not exist in the container, usually a share that is not mounted (`missing`);
- it exists but Polyfin may not list it, a permissions problem (`unreadable`);
- the path is a file (`not_folder`).

The files found before stay in the library while the folder cannot be read, so a share that is unmounted for a while empties no library.

A folder Polyfin cannot watch for changes is listed under **System › Health** too, as a warning: see [watching for changes](#watching-for-changes).

## Network shares

Polyfin reads folders shared over the network itself, without mounting them: SMB shares (Windows file sharing, which most NAS offer), WebDAV folders, prefixes of S3-compatible buckets, folders of SFTP servers, and folders of the many storages rclone reaches, through an rclone instance. Open **Sources**, choose **Add a source › Folder**, choose **SMB share**, **WebDAV folder**, **S3 bucket**, **SFTP folder** or **rclone remote**, and give its name, its address, its credentials, and whether it holds movies or shows. Everything else works as for a local folder: naming, matching, NFO files, discs and images, music, unmatched files, links, scans and versions.

Without these, such storage has to be mounted on the host, for example with `rclone mount`, and declared as a local folder: the mount has to be kept alive, a dropped one leaves the folder `missing`, inotify sees none of the changes made on the storage itself, and the credentials live in the host's configuration rather than encrypted by Polyfin.

### Addresses

- An SMB share is `smb://` then the server, the share, and the folder in the share if the videos are not at its root: `smb://nas.local/media/movies`. A server listening on another port than 445 takes it after its name: `smb://nas.local:4450/media`. Polyfin speaks SMB 2 and 3, and signs in with NTLM; SMB 1 is not supported.
- A WebDAV folder is its address: `https://nas.local/dav/movies`. Polyfin signs in with HTTP Basic authentication: prefer `https://`, since `http://` sends the password unencrypted.
- An S3 bucket is `s3://` then the bucket, and the prefix in it if the videos are not at its root: `s3://media/movies`. Its **Endpoint** is the address of the storage's S3 service, such as `https://s3.example.org`, and its **Region** the one requests are signed for, `us-east-1` when left empty, which most S3-compatible storages accept. Objects are listed as folders by `/`, with their size and last modified date; a folder is a prefix, and the empty objects some tools make for folders are left out. Polyfin names the bucket in the path of its requests (path-style), which every S3-compatible storage answers, but at Amazon's own endpoints (`*.amazonaws.com`), where the bucket is named in the host when its name allows it. A storage answering a range with `200 OK` and its `Content-Range`, as `rclone serve s3` does, is read as one answering `206`.
- An SFTP folder is `sftp://` then the server and the folder's full path on it: `sftp://nas.local/srv/media/movies`. A server listening on another port than 22 takes it after its name: `sftp://nas.local:2222/srv/media/movies`. Symbolic links on the server are followed.
- An rclone remote is read through an rclone instance running its remote control interface with `--rc-serve` (`rclone rcd --rc-serve`), such as a container next to Polyfin (see [installation](installation.md#an-rclone-container)), rather than Polyfin supporting each storage itself. Give the **rclone address**, such as `http://rclone:5572`, reached over `http://`, a **Remote** among those of rclone's configuration, which **List the remotes** asks rclone for (`config/listremotes`), and the **Path in the remote**. Its address is then `rclone://` the instance's host and port and the path: `rclone://rclone:5572/movies`. Folders are listed with `operations/list`, and files are read by ranges from the objects `--rc-serve` serves.
- A server sharing over WebDAV already works as a WebDAV folder, `rclone serve webdav` included.

The address holds no user or password: they have fields of their own, and an address with them is refused.

### Credentials

- **User** and **Password** are those of an account that may read the folder on the server. Leave both empty for a share open to guests. For an SMB domain account, write the user as `DOMAIN\user`.
- An S3 bucket takes an **Access key** and a **Secret key** in place of a user and password, those of a key that may list the bucket and read its objects. Leave both empty for a bucket everyone may read: its requests are then sent unsigned.
- An SFTP folder takes a **User**, and a **Password**, a **Private key**, or both. The key is an OpenSSH or PEM private key, pasted whole, with its **Passphrase** when it has one; a key that cannot be read, or a passphrase that does not open it, is refused.
- An rclone remote takes the user and password of rclone's remote control (`--rc-user` and `--rc-pass`), empty when it has none. The storage's own credentials stay in rclone's configuration.
- The passwords, secret keys, private keys and passphrases are stored encrypted with `POLYFIN_SECRET_KEY` like the other stored secrets (see [stored keys and tokens](configuration.md#stored-keys-and-tokens)), never shown again, and never written to the log. One the key cannot decrypt counts as wrong, the share failing as `refused`, and **System › Health** lists it under **Stored keys**.
- To change one, edit the folder and choose **Replace** beside it; left alone, the stored one stays. A private key is replaced by pasting another, and removed with **Remove the saved key**. New credentials scan the share again at once, and keep the files found, and its titles that could not be played meanwhile are tried again at once rather than 15 minutes later. A new address forgets the files found at the former one, links included.
- The stored secrets are only sent to the server they were given for. A folder moved to another server or port, or to another kind of share, and an S3 bucket given another endpoint, keep none of them: **Edit the folder** then asks for them again, and those left empty are removed on save. **List the remotes** uses the stored rclone password only at the folder's own rclone address. Another folder or bucket on the same server or endpoint keeps them.

#### SFTP host keys

The SFTP server's host key is saved at the first connection, and its fingerprint shown under **Edit the folder**. Polyfin refuses to connect when the server later offers another one, as `ssh` does: the folder fails with `host_key_changed` and keeps its files, its page shows it as **Cannot be read** as soon as the server offered the key, before the next scan, and **Edit the folder** shows the new key's fingerprint with **Accept the new key**. Accept it only when the server was reinstalled or its key changed on purpose; Polyfin then saves it, tries again at once the titles that could not be played meanwhile, and scans the folder again. A folder moved to another server forgets the key of the former one.

### Performance

- Files are read from the share at each request, with byte ranges. Direct play, remuxing, conversions, analysis and thumbnails read them through Polyfin as they read a local file; seeking asks the share for the part needed only.
- The videos of S3 buckets, SFTP folders and rclone remotes are read in blocks through Polyfin's source cache, straight from the storage, as addons' streams are (see [reading the sources](playback.md#reading-the-sources)): read ahead of the playback, kept on disk for seeks, and limited per host. They count against **Disk space for files being read (GB)** under **Settings › Playback**. S3 and rclone are read over HTTP with ranges, SFTP in blocks over the folder's SSH connection. Subtitle files, images, NFO files and discs are read from the storage by ranges, as on the other shares.
- Connections are kept between requests: one SMB session per share, signed in again when it ends, such as when the server restarts; HTTP keep-alive for WebDAV, S3 and rclone; one SSH connection per SFTP folder, made again when it drops.
- A scan lists the share folder by folder. Listings over the network are slower than on a disk, but scans only read the files that are new or changed, so the first scan is the long one. Shares follow the same schedule as local folders, **Settings › Catalogs › Scan local folders every (hours, 0 = never)**, and are watched for changes: through the server's notifications for SMB, by listing their folders again every 2 minutes for WebDAV, and as often as each folder asks for S3 buckets, SFTP folders and rclone remotes (see [watching for changes](#watching-for-changes)). A share mounted on the host and declared as a local folder is watched with inotify instead, which only sees the changes made through that host, not those made on the NAS.
- A video plays only as fast as the network carries it: a high bit rate movie needs a steady link to the server, which wired networks give more surely than Wi-Fi.

### Discs on shares

Blu-ray discs, DVDs and disc images on a share are read on the share itself, as on a local folder: they have the same titles, units, links and names (see [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs), [DVD folders](#dvd-folders) and [Disc images](#disc-images)).

- A scan reads a disc's playlists and IFO files, and an image's ISO 9660 or UDF file system, by byte ranges: a few reads per disc, the image never read whole.
- FFmpeg cannot read a disc from a share, so Polyfin serves it each title as one file:
  - for a Blu-ray disc, its playlist's clips, each from its in time to its out time, in order, the bytes FFmpeg's Blu-ray reader reads of a local disc, as one MPEG-TS stream;
  - for a DVD, its title's cells, in order, from its title set's `.VOB` files, as one MPEG program stream.
- A Blu-ray disc's video is copied when the app takes it, cut on the keyframes its clips' information files list, read on the share; a DVD's is converted, as on a local folder.
- A DVD's track languages and length come from its IFO files, as FFmpeg's DVD reader reads them on a local folder.

### Health

A share Polyfin cannot read is reported on its page and under **System › Health**, with why:

- the server does not answer: it is off, or the address's server or port is wrong (`unreachable`);
- the server refuses the user or password, the access key or secret key, or the private key (`refused`), also when the key cannot decrypt the one stored;
- the share, or the folder in it, does not exist (`missing`): for S3 a bucket the storage does not have, for rclone a remote the rclone instance does not know, or a folder missing in it;
- the user may not list the folder (`unreadable`);
- the address is a file (`not_folder`);
- an SFTP server offers another host key than the one saved (`host_key_changed`, see [SFTP host keys](#sftp-host-keys)).

An empty prefix of a bucket is an empty folder: S3 cannot tell it from a prefix that does not exist.

As with a local folder, the files found before stay in the library while the share cannot be read, so a NAS that is off for a while empties no library.

A share that was read but cannot be listed while it is watched is reported under **System › Health** as a warning, with why: it does not answer (`unreachable`), it refuses the user or password (`refused`), or an SFTP server offers another host key (`host_key_changed`). It keeps its schedule meanwhile, and is scanned again once it answers.

**System › Health › Network shares** lists each enabled share with how it is watched: **Notified** when its server tells of its changes, **Polled** when its folders are listed again every few minutes, with why: a WebDAV server, an SMB server that does not tell of changes, or did not tell of one a listing found, or whose notifications were lost and are asked for again, or an S3 bucket, SFTP folder or rclone remote, with how often. One listed only at its scans shows **At scans only**. A share that cannot be watched shows **Not watched**, with why.

## Naming files

Movies, one file per movie, alone or in a folder of its own, a Blu-ray disc or a DVD copied as it is (see [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs) and [DVD folders](#dvd-folders)), or a disc image (see [Disc images](#disc-images)):

```
/media/movies/Night of the Living Dead (1968).mkv
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Nosferatu (1922) - 1080p.mkv
/media/movies/The.General.1926.1080p.BluRay.mkv
```

Shows, a folder per show, the season and episode in each file's name, or discs copied as they are (see [Shows on discs](#shows-on-discs)):

```
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/The Lone Ranger - S01E02.mkv
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/The.Lone.Ranger.S02E10.720p.mkv
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/The Lone Ranger - S01E03-E04.mkv
```

`S01E02`, `s01e02`, `1x02` and, in a season folder, `E02` or `Episode 2` are read. A file holding several episodes, `S01E01-E02`, `S01E01E02` or `S01E01-02`, plays for each of them.

An identifier in a file's or folder's name settles its title: `{imdb-tt0063350}`, `[imdbid-tt0063350]`, `{tmdb-10331}` or `[tmdbid-10331]`.

Extras, local trailers and theme media, named as Jellyfin names them, are no titles: they show under their titles (see [Extras and theme media](#extras-and-theme-media)). Hidden folders and folders named `sample` are left out, as are a Blu-ray disc's streams and playlists, which its titles play, and the files of a DVD.

### Extras and theme media

A movie in a folder of its own, a show's folder and a season's folder may hold extras beside the titles, read as Jellyfin reads them:

```
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Nosferatu (1922).mkv
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Extras/Making of.mkv
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Nosferatu (1922)-featurette.mkv
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/trailer.mp4
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/backdrops/intro.mkv
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/theme.mp3
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/Deleted Scenes/Ambush.mkv
```

- The videos in folders named `Behind The Scenes`, `Deleted Scenes`, `Interviews`, `Scenes`, `Samples`, `Shorts`, `Featurettes`, `Clips`, `Other`, `Extras` or `Trailers`, in any letter case, are extras of that kind: `Extras` and `Other` hold extras of no kind in particular.
- So are the videos whose names end in `-trailer`, `.trailer`, `_trailer`, ` trailer`, `-sample`, `.sample`, `_sample`, ` sample`, `-scene`, `-clip`, `-interview`, `-behindthescenes`, `-deleted`, `-deletedscene`, `-featurette`, `-short`, `-other` or `-extra`, and those named `trailer` or `sample`.
- Theme songs are the audio files named `theme`, such as `theme.mp3`, and those in a `theme-music` folder; theme videos are the videos in a `backdrops` folder.
- An extra is never matched, listed nor offered as a version. Its name is its file's, without its extension or suffix, else its NFO file's `<title>`, else its file's as written: `Nosferatu (1922)-featurette.mkv` is named `Nosferatu (1922)`, `trailer.mp4` takes the title of `trailer.nfo` beside it.
- A link made by hand wins over the name: a file linked to a title (see [Unmatched files](#unmatched-files)) stays that title, or a version of it, whatever its name or folder. Removing the link makes it an extra again, at once.
- A movie's extras belong to the movies directly in their folder, its versions included; in a folder shared by several movies, an extra named with a suffix belongs to the one its name begins with, such as `Nosferatu (1922)-trailer.mkv` beside `Nosferatu (1922).mkv`, and the extras folders belong to none. An extra named with a suffix whose movie is not beside it is listed in the unmatched files, as "An extra without its title beside it", so that it can be linked: linked, it is a title. A disc folder is its movie's own. A show's folder holds the show's extras, and a season's folder, such as `Season 01` or `Specials`, the season's.
- Only the files directly in an extras folder are read; the other files of such a folder, discs and audio files among them, are left out, as is an audio file other than a theme song.

Apps show them as Jellyfin's do: jellyfin-web lists a title's extras under its Special Features, plays its local trailer from its Trailer button (the addons' trailers still show), and plays its theme songs and videos in the background of its page, and of its seasons' and episodes' pages, for the users who turned theme songs or videos on in its display settings. An extra shows its title's backdrop, and its title's poster to apps that ask for its Primary image. An extra plays as a local file does (see [Versions](#versions)): direct play, remux or conversion, with the subtitle files beside it, named after it. It has its own watch state and resume point, apart from its title's. Its user sees it while they see its title and its folder is one of their sources, as for the title's versions.

A folder's page shows how many extras its last scan found. **Read extras and theme media** (fr « Lire les bonus et les thèmes »), on a movies or shows folder's page, is on by default; off, the next scan leaves them out as scans did before Polyfin read them, the files with a suffix and those of `Clips` and `backdrops` folders being read as titles, and those of the other extras folders, samples and audio files left out. Home videos folders read no extras: their extras folders are left out.

Polyfin reads extras from version 0.39.0 on. On a server upgraded from an earlier version, the scan at the first start reads the extras of every movies and shows folder, the setting being on:

- the files earlier versions listed as titles or as versions of a title, such as `trailer.mp4`, `Nosferatu (1922)-featurette.mkv` and the videos of `Clips` and `backdrops` folders, are extras of their titles from then on, no longer versions; the videos of the other extras folders, which earlier versions left out, are extras too;
- the titles keep their watch state, resume points, favorites and ratings; the extras are new items, and start unplayed;
- a file linked by hand stays the title it was linked to, as above;
- an extra named with a suffix whose movie is not beside it, which earlier versions may have matched as a title of its own, is listed in the unmatched files, where linking it makes it a title again;
- turning **Read extras and theme media** off on a folder, then scanning it, keeps the earlier listing.

### Shows on discs

A show kept on discs, as box sets are, may be copied as it is into the show's folder or one of its season folders: a Blu-ray disc's folder, a DVD's folder or a disc image (see [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs), [DVD folders](#dvd-folders) and [Disc images](#disc-images)).

```
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/Disc 1/VIDEO_TS/VIDEO_TS.IFO
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/Disc 2/BDMV/PLAYLIST/00001.mpls
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 02/The Lone Ranger S02E01-E04.iso
```

The show is matched by its folder, as for its files: its name, its `tvshow.nfo` or a link. A disc's episodes are its titles, a Blu-ray disc's playlists or a DVD's titles:

- a title plays at least 3 minutes: shorter ones are trailers, menus' clips and most extras;
- a "play all" title, which chains other titles, is left out: it plays mostly the parts of two or more other titles, whatever their order, a DVD's cells or the parts of a Blu-ray disc's clips;
- a title playing the same parts as one of a lower number, such as an episode with another audio track, counts once;
- a disc keeps at most 40 titles, the first by number, in the order of their numbers.

A disc in a season folder is of that season; else of the season its name gives, as `Season 2 Disc 1` or `S02D01` do; else of season 1. Its place among the season's discs is the number its name gives: `Disc 2`, `DISC02`, `Disk 2`, `DVD 2`, `BD 2`, `Vol. 2`, `Part 2`, or the `D` of `S01D02`.

Each title holds the episodes:

- given by hand: the unmatched files list each title without episodes, as `DVD: The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/Disc 1 · title 3`, with its length; type its episode beside it as a file's name gives it, `S01E05`, or `S01E05-E06` for a title holding two (see [Unmatched files](#unmatched-files));
- else those of the disc's name, as `The Lone Ranger S02E01-E04.iso` or a disc folder named `S01E05-E08` give: its titles are numbered in order without asking, when the disc has as many titles as the name gives episodes.

Polyfin suggests each disc's episodes: its titles in order, after the episodes the season's discs before it hold, from episode 1 for a season's first, or from the first its name gives. **Use these episodes**, beside the disc, gives them all at once. The episodes given survive every scan, even while the disc is away, and are listed under **Linked by hand**, where removing them leaves the title to its disc's name, or to the suggestion, again.

An episode plays as another movie of a disc does: a DVD's title converted, through FFmpeg's DVD reader; a Blu-ray disc's playlist through its Blu-ray reader, its video copied when the app takes it; an image's from the image; and on a share, as on a local folder (see [Discs on shares](#discs-on-shares)). Through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the disc and its title, such as `Season 01 - Disc 2 - title 1.m2ts` or `The Lone Ranger S02E01-E04 - title 2.iso`.

Limits:

- A DVD whose episodes are the chapters of one title lists that title alone: give it all its episodes, such as `S01E01-E04`.
- A disc whose titles cannot be read is left out: a Blu-ray disc without playlists Polyfin reads, a DVD without IFO files it reads, and an image whose UDF file system it does not read.
- Extras of 3 minutes or more are listed as titles too: leave them without episodes.
- A DVD folder's episode is sized as its cells, and a Blu-ray disc folder's as the clips it plays, so the episodes cut from one clip each have the clip's size; an image's episodes each have the image's size, as its movies do.
- A disc at the root of a shows folder, or an image at its top, belongs to no show, and is left out.
- The titles of shows' discs have no subtitle files.
- A title's episodes are typed in the admin app or given by the disc's name: episodes' NFO files and chapter names are not read.

### NFO files

Folders organized by Jellyfin or a media manager often hold NFO files, which give each title's identifiers. Polyfin reads them from:

- a movie's own NFO file, the video's name with `.nfo`, such as `Nosferatu (1922) - 1080p.nfo`;
- else `movie.nfo` in the movie's folder, when that folder is the movie's own: its videos are all read as one title, such as the versions of one movie;
- a Blu-ray disc's `movie.nfo`, in its disc folder;
- a show's `tvshow.nfo`, in its folder.

```
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Nosferatu (1922) - 1080p.mkv
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/movie.nfo
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/tvshow.nfo
```

In XML NFO files, Polyfin reads `<uniqueid type="imdb">` and `<uniqueid type="tmdb">`, else the older `<imdbid>` and `<tmdbid>`, directly in the root element. An NFO file that is not XML may hold the address of the title's IMDb page instead. File names are compared in any case. Only the identifiers are read: titles, plots and ratings still come from the metadata addons, and artwork from them or the images beside the files (see [Artwork](#artwork)), and episodes' NFO files are not read.

### Subtitle files

Subtitle files beside a video (`.srt`, `.ass`, `.ssa`, `.vtt`, `.sup`, `.idx` and `.sub`) are not offered: Polyfin offers only the subtitle tracks inside the video files (see [Subtitles](subtitles.md)).

## Blu-ray discs

A Blu-ray disc copied as it is is a folder tree: the disc folder holds a `BDMV` folder, whose `STREAM` folder holds the disc's streams, `.m2ts` files, and whose `PLAYLIST` folder holds its playlists, `.mpls` files, beside `index.bdmv`, `CLIPINF` and often a `CERTIFICATE` folder. A movie is a playlist, which plays one or more streams in order; the other playlists are extras, menus and other cuts.

```
/media/movies/Night of the Living Dead (1968)/BDMV/PLAYLIST/00800.mpls
/media/movies/Night of the Living Dead (1968)/BDMV/STREAM/00001.m2ts
/media/movies/Box/DISC02/BDMV/PLAYLIST/00002.mpls
```

In a movies folder, any folder holding a `BDMV` folder (any case) is a disc. Its main title is its longest playlist:

- it plays whole, every stream in order, with its audio tracks, through FFmpeg's Blu-ray reader;
- its size is that of the streams it plays;
- its title is read from the disc folder's name, as a movie file's name is, the year coming from the folder above when the disc folder's name has none;
- a disc folder named only after the disc's number, such as `Disc 1`, `DISC01`, `Disk 2`, `CD1`, `BD 1` or `Part 2`, takes its title from the folder above;
- a disc at the root of a folder takes the folder's own name;
- a link covers the disc folder; the unmatched files list it as `Blu-ray disc: …`;
- through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the disc folder.

A disc holding several movies, as a box set's discs do, lists each other movie as a title of its own:

- a title is a playlist of at least 20 minutes that plays mostly streams the longer titles do not: another cut, angle or language of a movie counts once;
- a disc that would have more than 6 titles keeps its main title only, as some discs hide their movie among hundreds of playlists;
- a title other than the main one is not matched by the disc folder's name: link it by hand, beside its playlist in the unmatched files, listed as `Blu-ray disc: Box/DISC02 · title 2` for playlist `00002.mpls`;
- through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the disc folder and its number, such as `Box - DISC02 - title 2`.

A disc plays its playlists from its folder rather than as one file, so it plays over HLS only. Its segments are cut on the keyframes its clips' information files (`BDMV/CLIPINF/*.clpi`) list, so its video is copied when the app takes its codec, as a file's is: H.264 and HEVC, HDR10 included, on most apps; VC-1 and MPEG-2 video only on apps that declare them, and converted otherwise. Its audio is copied when the app takes it. A disc whose clips' information cannot be read is cut every few seconds and its video converted, as a DVD's is (see [DVD folders](#dvd-folders)).

Files beside `BDMV` in a disc folder are read as any other file, and its extras, such as an `Extras` folder, are its movie's (see [Extras and theme media](#extras-and-theme-media)).

In a shows folder, a show's disc is its episodes, its playlists chosen otherwise (see [Shows on discs](#shows-on-discs)).

Limits:

- A disc whose playlists cannot be read, or whose main title lasts less than 3 minutes, which FFmpeg's Blu-ray reader refuses, plays its largest stream, as one file, played as it is when the app takes it. A movie split over several streams then plays its largest stream only.
- On a network share, a disc is read as on a local folder (see [Discs on shares](#discs-on-shares)). A play item that ends before its clip does ends on the clip's next keyframe, as libbluray reads it: a title whose play items replay parts of clips, as seamless branching does, may show a few frames twice where they join.
- There is no direct play and no download of a playlist, and no thumbnails or chapter images are made for it.
- A seek in a disc starts FFmpeg one segment early, as its Blu-ray reader lands on the keyframe after the time asked: the first segment after a seek takes a little longer to come.
- The disc must not be encrypted: Polyfin reads discs copied without their copy protection.

Folders scanned before Polyfin read discs held one file per stream; their next scan leaves one per disc, read as above, and a link made on one of a disc's streams moves to the disc. Folders scanned by Polyfin 0.30 held a disc's largest stream; their next scan reads the disc's playlists, and the disc keeps its link.

## DVD folders

A DVD copied as it is is a disc folder holding a `VIDEO_TS` folder. `VIDEO_TS.IFO` lists the disc's titles; each title is in a title set, whose video is in `VTS_01_1.VOB`, `VTS_01_2.VOB` and so on for set 1. The movie is the disc's main title; the other titles are extras, trailers and menus' clips, or the other movies of a disc holding several.

```
/media/movies/Night of the Living Dead (1968)/VIDEO_TS/VIDEO_TS.IFO
/media/movies/Night of the Living Dead (1968)/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_1.VOB
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Disc 1/VIDEO_TS/VTS_02_1.VOB
```

In a movies folder, any folder holding a `VIDEO_TS` folder (any case) is a DVD, and its main title is one movie:

- it plays its main title, the longest the IFO files list, whole, with its audio tracks and chapters, through FFmpeg's DVD reader;
- its title, its year, a `Disc 1` folder and a DVD at the root of a folder are read as for [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs);
- its size is that of the main title's set, its `.VOB` files;
- a link covers the disc folder; the unmatched files list it as `DVD: …`;
- through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the disc folder.

A DVD holding several movies lists each other movie as a title of its own, with the rules of [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs):

- a title is one the IFO files list that plays at least 20 minutes, and mostly cells the longer titles do not: another cut of a movie, playing the same scenes, counts once;
- a DVD that would have more than 6 titles keeps its main title only;
- a title other than the main one is not matched by the disc folder's name: link it by hand, listed in the unmatched files as `DVD: Box/DISC02 · title 2` for title 2, beside the first `.VOB` of its set with its number, such as `VTS_02_1.VOB#2`;
- its size is that of its set's `.VOB` files;
- through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the disc folder and its number, such as `Box - DISC02 - title 2`.

The DVD is read from its folder rather than as one file, so it always plays converted: its video is converted over HLS, cut every few seconds as an MPEG-TS file's is, and its audio is copied when the app takes it. A user who may not have video converted is not offered it.

In a shows folder, a show's DVD is its episodes, its titles chosen otherwise (see [Shows on discs](#shows-on-discs)).

Limits:

- On a network share, a DVD's title is read as one MPEG program stream of its cells (see [Discs on shares](#discs-on-shares)) rather than through FFmpeg's DVD reader: it has no chapters, and its cells' timestamps are read as they are, without the corrections FFmpeg's DVD reader makes where they restart.
- There is no direct play, and no download.
- A DVD's subtitles are pictures (VobSub). They are not offered as files, so an app that draws subtitles itself gets none; an app that cannot show them gets them burned into the video.
- No thumbnails or chapter images are made for a DVD.
- A DVD's MPEG-2 video is converted even for an app that takes it: the IFO files' time maps tell where each second starts, not where each keyframe does, and FFmpeg's DVD reader starts a seek's timestamps at the time asked rather than at the keyframe it lands on, so copied segments would not join.
- The DVD must not be encrypted: Polyfin reads DVDs copied without their copy protection.

## Disc images

A disc kept as an image is an `.iso` file. In a movies folder, an image of a DVD or of a Blu-ray disc is one movie, its main title:

```
/media/movies/Night of the Living Dead (1968).iso
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Nosferatu (1922).iso
```

- its title is read from the image's file name, as a movie file's name is, the year coming from the folder above when the name gives none;
- a link covers the image; the unmatched files list it as `DVD image: …` or `Blu-ray image: …`;
- it plays its main title from the image itself: a DVD image its longest title, as a DVD folder does, and a Blu-ray image its longest playlist;
- through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the image's file.

An image holding several movies, as a box set's often does, lists each other movie as a title of its own, chosen as a DVD folder's or a Blu-ray disc folder's are: link it by hand, listed in the unmatched files as `Blu-ray image: Box.iso · title 2` beside the image's path with its number, `Box.iso#2`. Through the Jellyfin API, its version is named after the image and its number, such as `Box - title 2.iso`. In a shows folder, a show's image is its episodes, each beside the image's path with its number, `Disc 1.iso#2` (see [Shows on discs](#shows-on-discs)).

A scan reads what each new or changed image is, and its titles, and keeps the answer while the image's size and modification time stay the same. It reads the image's ISO 9660 file system, or its UDF one when the image has no ISO 9660 one holding the disc, as many Blu-ray images do (UDF 1.02 to 2.60, a UDF 2.50 metadata partition included):

- an image holding a `VIDEO_TS` folder is a DVD's, as DVD images are;
- one holding a `BDMV` folder is a Blu-ray disc's; when its playlists cannot be read, its main title is the playlist FFmpeg's reader takes for the longest;
- one whose UDF file system Polyfin does not read, as images of rewritable and write-once media have (a sparable or virtual partition, blocks other than 2,048 bytes), is a Blu-ray disc's when FFmpeg's Blu-ray reader opens it, which it tries once per new or changed image: as before Polyfin read UDF, it is one movie, the playlist FFmpeg's reader takes for the longest, and it plays converted;
- any other image, such as a data disc's, is left out.

An image plays as the disc it holds does (see [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs) and [DVD folders](#dvd-folders)): a Blu-ray image's video is copied when the app takes its codec, its keyframes read through the image's file system, and a DVD image's video is converted.

Images a scan read before Polyfin listed their other movies, and UDF-only images, are read again at the next scan; their main titles keep their links.

Limits:

- On a network share, an image is read on the share (see [Discs on shares](#discs-on-shares)); one whose titles cannot be read there, or whose UDF file system Polyfin does not read, is left out, as FFmpeg's Blu-ray reader cannot open it from the share.
- There is no direct play and no download, and no thumbnails or chapter images are made for an image.
- A Blu-ray image's main title must last at least 3 minutes, as FFmpeg's Blu-ray reader requires.
- An image whose UDF file system Polyfin does not read (see above) lists its main title only, and plays it converted.
- The image's disc must not be encrypted, and a DVD image's subtitles are pictures, as a DVD folder's are.

## Matching

Each file, each disc, or each show's folder, is matched to a title:

1. a link made by hand (see below);
2. else an identifier written in its name: an IMDb identifier as it is; a TMDB identifier through the metadata addons, which give its IMDb identifier;
3. else an identifier its NFO file gives (see [NFO files](#nfo-files)), read the same way, the IMDb identifier when it gives both;
4. else its name and year are searched in the server's metadata addons, the searches the metadata editor uses: the match is kept only when the addons find exactly one title of that name and kind, of that year when the name gives one.

The title is kept under its IMDb identifier, which the addons answer streams for, with its TMDB identifier when known. Without a metadata addon offering searches, only identifiers in names and NFO files, and links, match files.

A folder's figures tell how its matched files were matched: by an identifier in the name, by an NFO file, by a search or by hand.

## Unmatched files

A folder's page lists the files no title was found for, with why: the name gives no title or episode number, no title of that name, several titles of that name (add the year), titles of other years, the search failed, the file is another movie of a Blu-ray disc, which only a link matches, it is a title of a show's disc without its episodes, or it is an extra named with a suffix whose movie is not beside it (see [Extras and theme media](#extras-and-theme-media)), which only a link makes a title. Rename the file and scan again, add an NFO file giving its identifier, or type the IMDb identifier of the title (the `tt…` part of its IMDb address) beside it and choose **Link**. In a shows folder, the link covers the whole show folder; for a Blu-ray disc or a DVD, the whole disc folder, or one title of a disc holding several movies; for a disc image, the image. Links survive every scan, even when the file changes or is moved away and back; remove one from the folder's page to match it by its name or NFO file again. While the folder is scanned, the list follows the scan: the files found are added to it as they come, and an identifier being typed stays, so files can be linked before the scan ends.

A title of a show's disc is listed with its disc and number, such as `Blu-ray disc: The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 01/Disc 2 · title 1`, and its length; a disc's titles follow one another, in order, under the episodes Polyfin suggests for them (see [Shows on discs](#shows-on-discs)). Type a title's episode beside it, `S01E05` or `S01E05-E06`, and choose **Save**, or choose **Use these episodes** to give the disc's titles those suggested. A title whose show is matched leaves the list once numbered, and its episodes are listed under **Linked by hand**, where they can be removed. While its show is unmatched, a title keeps the show's reason and its link form, which links the show.

To find the title without leaving Polyfin, choose **Find the title** beside a file. The search is filled with what the file's name was read as, and its year; change them and choose **Search**, or press Enter. Polyfin searches the server's metadata addons for titles of the folder's kind, movies or shows, and lists at most 10 with their poster, name, year and kind, those of the year given first. Choosing one links the file, its show folder or its disc, as typing its identifier does. Only titles with an IMDb identifier are listed, since links are made to IMDb identifiers; for a title the search does not find, type its identifier.

## Scanning

Folders are scanned at startup, every **Settings › Catalogs › Scan local folders every (hours, 0 = never)** (6 by default, 0 turns the schedule off), and when an administrator chooses **Scan now** on a folder or runs **Scan local folders** under **System › Schedule** (which scans every folder).

### Watching for changes

Folders mounted in the container are also watched for changes, with inotify on Linux. When files are added, renamed or removed in a folder, or in any folder under it, Polyfin waits until they stop changing for a few seconds, then scans that folder again. A movie copied into a folder shows in its library within a minute of the copy's end, without **Scan now**.

- **Settings › Catalogs › Watch folders and shares for changes** turns it off or on, for folders and network shares alike (on by default). Off, no folder or share is watched.
- Network shares are watched through their server's notifications for SMB, and by listing their folders again for WebDAV, S3 buckets, SFTP folders and rclone remotes, as described below.
- The schedule and **Scan now** stay, as a safety net for changes a watch misses.
- A folder that disappears is scanned, which reports it missing; when it is back, it is scanned and watched again within a minute.
- Hidden folders and the folders a scan leaves out, such as a home videos folder's `Extras`, are not watched, and changes to files other than videos, theme songs, disc images, NFO files, subtitle files, images (see [Artwork](#artwork)), a DVD's `.IFO` and `.VOB` files and a Blu-ray disc's playlists do not start a scan. The folders of extras of movies and shows folders are watched as their titles' folders are (see [Extras and theme media](#extras-and-theme-media)), whether the folder reads extras or not. In a music folder, its subfolders named `Extras` or `Other` are watched, as its scans read them, and its audio files, artwork, lyrics files and playlists start a scan.

An SMB server tells Polyfin of the changes on a share: Polyfin asks it to report each change in the share's folder and in every folder under it (SMB's change notifications). After a change, Polyfin waits until the changes stop for a few seconds, as for a folder in the container, then scans the share again, which reads only what changed. A movie copied onto the share, renamed or removed shows within seconds of the copy's end. When the server had too many changes to tell them one by one, the share is scanned all the same.

- The share's folders are still listed again every 10 minutes, as described below, in case a change goes untold.
- Samba tells of every change made through the network, but of those made on the server's own disk, such as by a download client running on the NAS, only those in the share's folder itself, not in the folders under it. When a listing finds such a change in a folder of the share that the server did not tell of, Polyfin keeps the notifications and lists the share's folders every 2 minutes too.
- When the server ends Polyfin's session, such as when it restarts, Polyfin signs in again, asks again for its changes, and scans the share for what changed meanwhile. While the server cannot be reached, Polyfin asks again every 30 seconds, and lists the share's folders every 2 minutes.
- Windows servers were seen to accept a watch of a whole share from its top folder and never answer it. When a listing finds a change in a share's top folder that the server did not tell of, Polyfin watches that top folder and each folder in it apart, which Windows answers. When that watch is silent too, or the top folder holds more than 256 folders, the share is listed every 2 minutes until Polyfin restarts. An address that names a folder of the share, such as `smb://nas.local/media/Movies`, rather than the share itself, avoids this.
- The folders watched stay open to others: they can be renamed, moved or deleted while Polyfin watches them. Polyfin never writes to a share.
- **System › Health › Network shares** tells which shares are notified of their changes and which are polled, and why (see [Health](#health)).

WebDAV servers give no notice of their changes, nor do SMB servers that refuse to, S3 buckets, SFTP servers or rclone remotes. So Polyfin lists those shares' folders again every 2 minutes, and compares each listing with the one its last scan read: the names of its folders, and the names, sizes and modification times of its videos, NFO, subtitle and other files a scan reads. When one differs, the share is scanned again a few seconds later, which reads only what changed. A movie copied onto such a share shows within a few minutes of the copy's end.

- Each round lists the share's top folder first, where a new movie's folder lands, then the folders under it in turn, at most 100 listings a round, half a second apart. A share of more folders is listed whole over several rounds, from where the last round stopped: with 1,000 folders, a change deep in it is seen within 20 minutes, a new folder at the top within 2.
- The folders listed are those the last scan read: hidden folders and those a scan leaves out are not, and a new folder is seen through its parent's listing.
- The first round comes 2 minutes after Polyfin starts, or after the share is added, which are scanned then anyway.
- A copy still under way may be scanned before it ends; the next round sees its size change and scans it again.
- A share that cannot be listed is reported under **System › Health** (see [Health](#health)), and scanned again once it answers.

S3 buckets, SFTP folders and rclone remotes are listed so too, but each as often as its **Look for changes every (minutes, 0 = only at scans)** asks, set on the folder's form: 2 minutes by default for SFTP folders and rclone remotes, 30 for S3 buckets, as S3 providers may bill each listing (a round of a bucket lists one folder per request, its pages of 1,000 entries each a request). 0 lists the folder only at its scans, which its schedule and **Scan now** make. A change of it applies at once.

A storage served through `rclone serve` (`webdav`, `s3` or `sftp`) answers from rclone's directory cache, which keeps each listing for 5 minutes by default (`--dir-cache-time`): a file added on the storage behind it shows only once rclone lists that folder again, up to 5 minutes later than these listings alone would find it. Start `rclone serve` with a shorter `--dir-cache-time`, such as `--dir-cache-time 30s`, for changes to show sooner.

Linux limits the folders one user may watch, with `fs.inotify.max_user_watches`. Polyfin watches each folder of a tree, so a large library may reach it. A folder that cannot be watched is still scanned on its schedule; **System › Health** lists it with why, and Polyfin tries again every 10 minutes. The container shares the host's limits, so raise it on the host:

```sh
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/90-inotify.conf
sudo sysctl --system
```

When Health says the limit of watchers or of open files is reached, raise `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` the same way, or the container's limit of open files (`--ulimit nofile=…` with Docker).

On macOS, Polyfin watches each folder and each file of a tree through a file it keeps open, so a very large library may reach the limit of open files of a process. Health then says so (`open_files_limit`); raise the limit, which lasts until the Mac restarts:

```sh
sudo sysctl kern.maxfiles=524288 kern.maxfilesperproc=262144
```

Windows has no such limit: a folder it cannot watch is told as a failure, and tried again every 10 minutes too.

A scan reads only what changed: a file is new or changed by its path, size and modification time; files gone are forgotten; files whose title is known keep it without asking the addons again. An NFO file is read when it is new or changed the same way; one added, changed or removed matches its movie, disc or show again, even when the videos did not change, and one removed leaves it to its name and the search. Subtitle files and images added, changed or removed are offered as they are now from the next scan on. Files left unmatched are matched again at each scan. A few titles are looked up at once, so a large first scan takes a while; the folder's figures follow it. On a share, NFO and subtitle files and images are listed with the folders, and only the NFO files new or changed are read.

Symbolic links to files of the folder are followed; links leading out of the folder, and links to folders, are not.

## Changing what a folder holds

On a folder's page under **Sources**, **Edit the folder** changes what it holds, **It holds**: movies, shows, music or home videos. Before changing anything, the admin app says what follows and what is dropped, and asks. The folder keeps its library, which apps know by its identifier, with its place in their home screens and menus, its address, user and password, and its other settings. A scan under way stops, and the folder is scanned again as the new kind, in the background.

- Between movies, shows and home videos, what users did with a video follows it, as an import adds it (see [How the data merges with Polyfin's](users.md#how-the-data-merges-with-polyfin-s)): a played mark is added, the newer resume point is kept, and a favorite is set. A home video that becomes a movie or an episode gives it its watch state, resume point and favorite; a movie or an episode that becomes a home video gives the home video theirs. A file the new scan does not match gets them once it is matched, by hand or by a later scan.
- Played marks and favorites are given: the former titles keep theirs. A resume point moves, as it was recorded through the file, which the former title no longer plays: the former title loses it once the new one has it, or a newer one, so that Continue Watching lists the file once. A new title played before the resume point was set takes none, as with an import, and the former title then keeps it.
- A folder turned away from home videos keeps its videos' identifiers for 30 days (see [Titles](#titles)): meanwhile they leave Continue Watching, and holding home videos again within that time, it lists them as the same titles, with what users did with them.
- The links made by hand and the episodes given to shows' discs are dropped: each was made for one kind.
- To or from music, nothing follows: songs and videos are other files. What users did with the former titles stays with them and no longer shows.

## Versions

A matched file is one more version of its title, or of each of its episodes, named after the folder, with the resolution its name gives and its size, such as `Movies · 1080p · 4.2 GB`. Polyfin reads it from the disk or the share, with byte ranges, and plays it like any other version: direct play, remux or conversion, with its embedded audio and subtitle tracks and the subtitle files beside it. A Blu-ray disc's playlist, a DVD and a disc image play over HLS only, a Blu-ray disc's video copied when the app takes it and a DVD's converted (see [Blu-ray discs](#blu-ray-discs), [DVD folders](#dvd-folders) and [Disc images](#disc-images)). The folder's library lists its titles, the latest found first.

An episode whose file has no intro or credits in its chapters, of a series or a season the segment databases do not know, gets the intro and the credits the episodes of its season share in their audio, once one of them was played (see [Intros and credits found in local episodes' audio](skip-segments.md#intros-and-credits-found-in-local-episodes-audio)).

### Listing local files first

A folder's versions take its place among the sources: moving it up under **Content › Sources** puts its files before the addons' streams while no criterion orders versions. With criteria, such as **Preferred audio language**, a local file often ranks low: a scan does not analyze the files, so a file's audio languages are known only once it was played, or from its name or RemuxDB's description, and it counts as of unknown language until then. To list a folder's files first whatever the other criteria, choose **Source, in the order below** first under **Settings › Playback › Order versions by**, and move the folder to the top of **Order of sources**; the next criteria then sort each source's versions. Placed after the language, the criterion only orders the versions the language ties on. See [Version order](playback.md#version-order).

## Artwork

Folders organized by Jellyfin or a media manager often hold posters, backdrops and logos beside their files, chosen by hand. Polyfin reads them as Jellyfin does, as `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` or `.webp` files, names compared in any letter case, and shows them in place of the metadata addons' artwork of the same type; the types a folder has no image of still come from the addons.

```
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/Nosferatu (1922).mkv
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/poster.jpg
/media/movies/Nosferatu (1922)/fanart.jpg
/media/movies/The General (1926).mkv
/media/movies/The General (1926)-poster.jpg
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/poster.jpg
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/season01-poster.jpg
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 02/folder.jpg
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 02/The Lone Ranger - S02E01.mkv
/media/shows/The Lone Ranger (1949)/Season 02/The Lone Ranger - S02E01-thumb.jpg
```

A movie's images are named after its file, `<file name>-<name>`, such as `The General (1926)-poster.jpg`, its poster also `<file name>.jpg`; when the movie is alone in its folder (every video directly in it is the same movie, its versions included), or is a Blu-ray disc or a DVD, whose images sit in its disc folder, the names alone count too, such as `poster.jpg`. In a folder holding several movies, `poster.jpg` belongs to none of them. Of each type, the first name found counts:

| Type | Names |
|---|---|
| Primary (poster) | `poster`, `folder`, `cover`, `default`, `movie` |
| Backdrop | `fanart`, `fanart-1` to `fanart-20`, `background`, `background-1`…, `art`, `art-1`…, `backdrop`, `backdrop1`… |
| Logo | `logo`, `clearlogo` |
| Thumb | `landscape`, `thumb` |
| Banner | `banner` |
| Art | `clearart` |
| Disc | `disc`, `cdart`, `discart` |

The names after the file's name come before the names alone, and `.jpg` before `.jpeg`, `.png` and `.webp`. A title has one backdrop: the first found.

A show's images are in its folder, with the same names (`show` in place of `movie`, and no Disc image), alone or after the folder's name. A season's are in the show's folder, named after the season, `season01-poster`, `season01-fanart`, `season01-banner` and `season01-landscape` (`season1-…` comes first when both are there), and for the specials `specials-…` or `season-specials-…`; then in its season folder, the folder directly in the show's holding its episodes, with the names of the table, such as `folder.jpg` or `poster.jpg`. A season without a poster of its own shows its show's, as with the addons' artwork.

An episode's image is beside its file, named after it, with the names Jellyfin reads for episodes: `<file name>-thumb`, such as `The Lone Ranger - S02E01-thumb.jpg`, then `<file name>` alone, such as `The Lone Ranger - S02E01.jpg`, then the same two names in a `metadata` folder beside the file. It shows in place of the metadata addon's still, for each episode the file holds (both episodes of `S01E03-E04`). Other images beside the file, such as `<file name>-poster.jpg`, are not the episode's. The episodes of shows' discs and disc images (see [Shows on discs](#shows-on-discs)) have no file of their own: they keep the addon's still.

The images belong to the title the file, disc or show folder is matched to, and an episode's to the episodes its file holds, a link made by hand included, from the moment the link is made. When the files of a title in several folders have images, each type comes from the folder listed first on the **Sources** page, then from the first of the title's files or folders by path; a disabled folder gives none.

**Use its artwork**, on the form of a movies or shows folder, chooses whether its titles and episodes show its images; it is on by default, and turning it off brings the addons' artwork and stills back at once. Artwork an administrator uploads in a Jellyfin app wins over both.

Images are read from the folder or the share when an app first asks for them, then kept with the other artwork, at the sizes apps ask for. A scan notices an image added, replaced or removed, an episode's too, by its size and modification time, and apps see the new one, since its tag changes.

## Music folders

A folder or share added as holding **Music** is a music library of its own. Its audio files are read with their tags and grouped into albums and artists, and the library answers as an [Eclipse music addon](addons-and-libraries.md#music-addons)'s does: albums, artists and songs views, album and artist pages, search, lyrics, scrobbling, statistics and playback all work as for an addon's music. What a folder holds can change (see [Changing what a folder holds](#changing-what-a-folder-holds)): to or from music, nothing users did follows.

A scan lists the files ending in `.mp3`, `.flac`, `.m4a`, `.m4b`, `.alac`, `.aac`, `.ogg`, `.oga`, `.opus`, `.wav`, `.aif`, `.aiff`, `.wma`, `.ape`, `.wv` and `.dsf`, and beside them the artwork images, the lyrics files (`.lrc`) and the playlists (`.m3u` and `.m3u8`). Hidden folders are left out; a music folder's subfolders named `Extras` or `Other` are read, as an album may bear such a name.

Each new or changed file is read with ffprobe: its title, artist, artists, album, album artist, track and disc numbers, year (from its date), genres (several separated by `;`), whether it is part of a compilation, its lyrics, its length, its audio and whether it embeds a cover. Tags of MP3 (ID3), FLAC, Ogg and Opus (Vorbis comments), MP4 and M4A, WMA and WAV are read as ffprobe reads them.

A scan also keeps a file's gains, which even the volume between songs (see [Volume between songs](addons-and-libraries.md#volume-between-songs)): its `REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN` and `REPLAYGAIN_ALBUM_GAIN` tags, from ID3, Vorbis comments and MP4 alike, such as `-6.54 dB`, else Opus's `R128_TRACK_GAIN` and `R128_ALBUM_GAIN`, moved from EBU R128's -23 LUFS to the same -18 LUFS reference. The first scan after the upgrade that brought gains reads the tags of the files already kept again, once. With **Measure the loudness of songs without a gain** set to **Local songs** or **Local and addon songs**, the songs without a track gain are measured in the background after each scan, once, and again when their file changes; songs longer than 15 minutes never are.

A file without some tags takes them from its path, as in `Artist/Album/01 Title.flac`:

- its title is its name without the number heading it, which is its track number (`1-07 Title` gives disc 1, track 7);
- its album is its folder's name; a folder named only after a disc, such as `CD2` or `Disc 2`, gives the disc number, and the folder above gives the album;
- its artist is the name of the folder above the album's.

A file whose tags and path give no title or no album, such as an untagged file at the folder's root, is left out of the library, and its page lists it under **Tracks left out** with why.

On a share, ffprobe and FFmpeg read each new or changed file through Polyfin, at most 16 MB of it per scan: the tags, the stream headers and the embedded cover at its head, and the index at its end for the MP4 files that keep it there. A file whose tags lie beyond is read by its path.

### Albums and artists

- Tracks of the same album name and album artist, in any letter case, are one album. A track's album artist is its album artist tag, else "Various Artists" for a compilation (the compilation tag set to 1), else its artist tag as written.
- A track's artists are the names of its artists tag (a tag given several times, as Vorbis comments allow), else of its artist tag, separated by `;`: `Ann; Ben` gives Ann and Ben, each with their page, the song listed under each. Its artist tag is kept as written, for search. An album's artists are its album artist tag's, split the same way.
- An album's tracks are in disc, then track order, then by path. Its title and artist are those of its first track; its year, the latest of its tracks'; its genres, all of theirs.
- Albums group into artists by album artist. An artist's page lists their albums and their songs, including those on other artists' albums, at most 100.
- An album's artwork is the cover its first track embedding one embeds, else `cover`, `folder` or `front` (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` or `.webp`, any letter case) beside its first track.
- An artist's picture is `artist`, `folder` or `photo` (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` or `.webp`, any letter case) in their folder: the folder holding the folders of their albums, and of no album of another artist. Without one, it is the artwork of their first album. The artists views show it.
- Search finds songs by title, artist and album, albums by title and artist, and artists by name; every word must be found, in any letter case.

The folder's figures count its tracks, albums and album artists, its tracks with a gain (from their tags or measured) and those measured, and the tracks left out.

### Playlists

The `.m3u` and `.m3u8` files of the folder are the playlists of its library: its Playlists view lists them with the user's own playlists, by name. A playlist's title is its `#PLAYLIST:` line, else its file's name. Its lines name tracks by paths relative to the playlist's folder, or absolute within the folder's path in the container (as paths or `file:` addresses), with slashes or backslashes, in any letter case; its songs are those, in order. A line that names no track of the folder, or leads out of it, is left out; a playlist naming none is not listed. Search finds playlists by title.

### Lyrics

A song's lyrics are those of the `.lrc` file of the same name beside it, else those of its lyrics tag, synced line by line when timed, plain otherwise. They come before LRCLIB's: Polyfin never asks LRCLIB about a song with lyrics of its own, and serves them with **Song lyrics from LRCLIB** off too. Other songs have LRCLIB's (see [Lyrics](addons-and-libraries.md#lyrics)).

### Playback

Songs play from the folder or the share through Polyfin, as other local files do: as they are when the app takes their format, else converted as an addon's songs are (see [Music playback](addons-and-libraries.md#music-playback)). Their format, codec, sample rate and bit depth come from the scan, so playback decides without probing them.

### Rescans

A rescan reads again the files new or changed by size and modification time, forgets the files gone, and chooses again the artwork of the albums and artists whose first track or image changed. Lyrics files and playlists are read again when they change. Watching notices audio files, artwork, lyrics files and playlists, as it notices videos.

The tracks a scan first finds count among the files added of the [weekly summary](notifications.md#weekly-summary), which names them by album.

### Limits

- A folder's playlists are read only: apps cannot add songs to them, reorder or delete them. On a share, a playlist's absolute paths name nothing; relative paths do.
- Artist names split at `;` only: `A feat. B`, `A & B` or `A/B` is one artist unless an artists tag names them. Without an album artist tag, an album's artist is the artist tag as written, one name.
- Apps list a song's artists one by one, as Jellyfin does, rather than its artist tag as written.
- The artists views list album artists; an artist credited only on songs is reached from those songs and from search.
- Lyrics are read from `.lrc` files and tags, not from `.txt` files.

## Home videos

A folder or share added as holding **Home videos** (fr « Vidéos personnelles ») lists videos no metadata addon knows: recordings of a family, a concert or a school play. Each video is a title of its own, which the folder names, dates and plays itself: nothing is sent to the metadata addons, and nothing is ever unmatched. What a folder holds can change (see [Changing what a folder holds](#changing-what-a-folder-holds)): its videos' watch state follows them to the movies and episodes they become, and back.

```
/media/family/Beach.mp4
/media/family/School play 2018/play.mp4
/media/family/School play 2018/play.nfo
/media/family/Trip/day 1.mov
/media/family/Trip/day 2.mov
/media/family/Trip/day 2-poster.jpg
```

### Titles

- A video alone in a folder of its own, with its side files, is one title named after the folder (`School play 2018`). Several videos in one folder are as many titles, each named after its file without its extension (`day 1`, `day 2`); so is a video at the folder's top (`Beach`). Names are kept as written: no year or quality is read out of them.
- A title's NFO file is the video's own (`play.nfo`), else `movie.nfo` in the video's own folder. Its `<title>` names the title, its `<plot>` describes it, and its date is its `<premiered>`, else `<aired>`, else `<releasedate>`.
- Without a date in its NFO file, a title is dated by the creation time its video tells, as phones and cameras write it (`creation_time`, or the time Apple's devices write with its time zone), else by its file's modification time. A creation time before 1971, from a clock never set, is not believed. An NFO file that gives a `<year>` alone keeps the video's own date when it is of that year, and is the 1st of January of it otherwise.
- Its artwork is the images beside it, with the names a movie's take (see [Artwork](#artwork)): `day 2-poster.jpg`, or `poster.jpg` in its own folder. Without a poster, it shows a frame of the video, taken a tenth into it as Jellyfin takes one, at most 640 pixels wide as chapter images are, kept with the scan and made again when the video changes.
- Subtitle files beside a video are offered with it, as for any local file. Discs and disc images are left out, as in a shows folder.

A title's identifier is kept with its video through scans and restarts, and follows it when it is renamed or moved: what users did with it, its watch state, resume point, favorites and collections, stays with it, and apps' links to it still lead to it. A scan reads the size of each video it finds and a hash of its first and last MiB, once, when it first finds it or the file changes. A video found with the size and hash of exactly one video gone is that video again:

- renamed, moved into a subfolder, or in a folder renamed, as `Trip/day 2.mov` becoming `Summer 2019/Beach.mov`;
- moved into another Home videos folder, whichever folder is scanned first. When the folder it went to is scanned first, the video is still in the one it left, and the video found is a new title for a moment: the scan of the folder it left, finding it gone, gives it back its identifier, unless users already did something with the new title (played, marked, rated, made a favorite, added to a collection or playlist, given a subtitle file or edited), which then stays as it is. A copy and a delete seen by scans in between, as a slow move between disks, count as a move too;
- moved out and back within 30 days: the videos gone from every Home videos folder of the server are remembered for 30 days, those of a folder removed, given another path or holding something else too.

A copy is a title of its own while its original is still there, and stays one when the original goes later, its folder scanned after the copy was found. So are videos when several gone, or several found by one scan, have the same contents. A video replaced at the same path, its contents changed, keeps its title. A video found again keeps the time it was first found: the weekly summary does not count it as added.

### In apps

The folder is a library of Jellyfin's `homevideos` type, its titles `Video` items, as Jellyfin's home videos are: jellyfin-web shows it with its Folders and Videos views, newest recording first in the Folders view. Search, watch state, resume points, Continue Watching, collections, the libraries a user sees, allowed hours and downloads work as for other titles, and the videos play, seek and show their scrubbing thumbnails as other local files do.

A home video no folder holds any more, deleted from disk or in a folder that holds something else now, leaves Continue Watching and the lists of resumable, favorite and played items. What users did with it stays: found again within 30 days (see [Titles](#titles)), it shows again with its watch state and resume point. A movie or an episode a home video became stays listed, as its addon still describes it, but its resume point goes back to the video with the file (see [Changing what a folder holds](#changing-what-a-folder-holds)).

Parental control judges them as Jellyfin judges its videos: unrated, of the **Other** kind. A user blocking unrated **Other** items sees none of them; a highest rating alone hides none.

Tracking services and scrobbling never hear of them: they have no identifier a service knows. The [weekly summary](notifications.md#weekly-summary) counts the videos a scan first finds among the files added, as videos, never as movies.

The folder's page counts its videos, and how many are dated by an NFO file, by their recording and by their file. It has no unmatched files and no links.

### Limits

- Polyfin reads no other field of NFO files, such as people, tags or ratings, and does not write them.
- A video is one title: several files of one recording are not joined, and a folder holding several videos is no title of its own.
- A frame is made once per video as it is; one that cannot be made (an unreadable video) is tried again only once the video changes.
- A video renamed or moved and changed at once, or before a scan read its contents, is another title. The first scan after updating Polyfin reads the contents of the videos found before.

## Compared with Jellyfin

- Jellyfin reads metadata from files and providers of its own; Polyfin takes titles and their descriptions from the metadata addons, and a local file adds a version, and its artwork when the folder holds some.
- Both watch folders for changes. Polyfin also scans them at startup, on its schedule and on demand, and watches the network shares it reads itself by listing them again every few minutes.
- Jellyfin's "Identify" matches an item by hand from a search of its providers; Polyfin links an unmatched file to an IMDb identifier, typed or chosen from a search of the metadata addons.
- Both read the identifiers of NFO files; Polyfin reads nothing else of them for movies and shows, neither names, plots nor artwork, and only the title, plot and date for home videos.
- Both offer the subtitle files beside a video, named after it, text and pictures (`.sup`, and `.idx` with `.sub`). Polyfin reads only those in the video's own folder.
- Both read the artwork beside movies and shows, and the image beside an episode's file, with the same names. Polyfin keeps one backdrop per title, reads no `extrafanart` folder, `.gif`, `.tbn` or `.svg` image, nor images for the episodes of discs, and shows the addons' artwork of the types a folder has none of.
- Both read music folders with their tags, their playlists and their lyrics files. Polyfin groups albums by album artist and name rather than by folder, splits artists at `;` only, and reads no `.txt` lyrics.
- Both read extras, local trailers and theme media with the same names. Polyfin reads them only beside movies in folders of their own, shows and seasons, not beside episodes, reads only the files directly in an extras folder, and names an extra without its suffix.
- Both list home videos as `Video` items of a `homevideos` library, judged as **Other** by parental control, with a frame of the video when no image is beside it. Polyfin dates them by the recording's creation time as well, lists no photos nor photo albums in such a library, makes a video alone in its folder a title named after the folder, and keeps a video's item when it is renamed or moved, where Jellyfin makes another.

## For app developers

A local folder or network share is an addon of kind `local` in the admin API, listed with the other sources (`GET /admin/api/scopes/shared/addons`), its `folder` field describing its path or address, kind (`movies`, `shows` or `music`), last scan, error, counts and links, `useArtwork`, whether its titles show the artwork beside its files (see [Artwork](#artwork)), `readExtras`, whether its scans read the extras beside its titles, and `extras`, how many its last scan found (see [Extras and theme media](#extras-and-theme-media)). `episodes` lists the episodes given by hand to the titles of shows' discs: `[{"path", "disc", "discPath", "number", "episode"}]`, `disc` the disc's kind as in the unmatched files (empty while an image is gone), `discPath` its folder or image, `number` the title's and `episode` such as `S01E05` or `S01E05-E06`. `matchedBy` counts its matched files by how they were matched: `{"name", "nfo", "search", "link"}`. For a music folder, `files` counts its tracks, `matched` those in an album, `unmatched` those left out, and `albums` and `artists` its albums and their artists; its unmatched files are the tracks left out, with `reason` `no_title` or `no_album`. For a share, `share` is `"smb"` or `"webdav"` (empty for a local folder), `user` its user, and `passwordSet` whether a password is stored; the password itself is never answered. `error` is `missing`, `unreadable`, `not_folder`, or for a share `unreachable` or `refused`; empty after a scan that could read the folder. The administrator routes are:

| Route | What it does |
|---|---|
| `POST /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders` | adds a folder: `{"name", "path", "kind": "movies" or "shows"}`, and for a share `"user"` and `"password"`; `path` is a path in the container or a share's address; `"useArtwork": false` adds a movies or shows folder whose artwork its titles do not show, `"readExtras": false` one whose scans read no extras. An S3 bucket also takes `"endpoint"` and `"region"`, its `user` and `password` being its access key and secret key; an SFTP folder `"privateKey"` and `"passphrase"`; an rclone remote `"rcloneRemote"`; those three `"pollMinutes"`, from 0 to 1,440, their kind's default when left out |
| `POST /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/rclone-remotes` | lists the remotes of an rclone instance, `{"address", "user", "password"}`, `address` such as `http://rclone:5572`; with `"folder"`, a folder's identifier, and no `password`, the one stored for that folder when `address` is that rclone folder's own instance, else none: `{"remotes": […], "error"}`, `error` `unreachable` or `refused` when rclone could not tell them |
| `PATCH /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}` | changes its `name`, `path`, `user`, `password`, `endpoint`, `region`, `privateKey`, `passphrase`, `rcloneRemote`, `pollMinutes`, `useArtwork`, `readExtras` (applied at the next scan) or `kind`; `"acceptHostKey": true` accepts the host key an SFTP server offers in place of the one saved; a new path or address forgets the files found; a `password`, `privateKey` or `passphrase` left out keeps the stored one, an empty one removes it, but a `path` on another server, port or kind of share, or an S3 `endpoint` on another server, removes those left out; a new `kind` (`movies`, `shows`, `music` or `homevideos`, else `invalid_folder_kind`) keeps the folder's identifier and its library's, stops its scan under way, forgets its files, links and discs' episodes, and scans it again |
| `POST /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}/scan` | starts a scan (202) |
| `GET /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}/unmatched` | `{"total", "files": [{"path", "unit", "title", "year", "size", "reason", "disc", "discTitle"}]}`; `disc` is `"bluray"` for a Blu-ray disc's playlist or stream and `"dvd"` for a DVD, its `unit` the disc folder, or for a title other than a disc's main one the disc folder, `#` and its playlist's or title's number (`Box/DISC02#00002`), `"dvd_image"` or `"bluray_image"` for a disc image, its `unit` the image, or for a title other than its main one the image, `#` and its number (`Box.iso#00002`), and `null` for other files. A DVD's or an image's title other than its main one has as `path` its disc's file with `#` and its number (`Box/VIDEO_TS/VTS_02_1.VOB#2`, `Box.iso#2`), which links take as any path. A title of a show's disc has as `unit` its show's folder, as `reason` `disc_episode` while its show is matched, and `discTitle` `{"discPath", "number", "length", "episode", "suggested"}`: its disc's folder or image, its number, how long it plays in seconds (null when unknown), its episodes and those suggested, such as `S01E05` (null for none); `discTitle` is null for other files. A disc's titles follow one another, in the order of their numbers |
| `GET /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}/titles?query=…&year=…` | searches the metadata addons for titles of the folder's kind: `{"titles": [{"imdbId", "name", "year", "kind", "posterId"}]}`, at most 10, only titles with an IMDb identifier, those of `year` (optional) first; `kind` is `movie` or `show`, and `posterId` the item whose Primary image (`/Items/{posterId}/Images/Primary`) is the poster, null without one. A failed search answers 502, `addon_unreachable` when an addon could not be reached, `title_search_failed` otherwise |
| `PUT /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}/links` | links `{"path", "imdbId"}`; `path` is a file, a show's folder or a disc's folder |
| `DELETE /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}/links?path=…` | removes a link |
| `PUT /admin/api/scopes/shared/folders/{id}/episodes` | gives titles of shows' discs their episodes, `{"episodes": [{"path", "episode"}]}`, at most 1,000: `path` a title's, as the unmatched files give it, `episode` as a file's name gives it (`S01E05`, `s1e5`, `S01E05-E06`, `S01E05E06`), an empty one removing those given. Answers the folder; `invalid_episode` (400) for an episode written otherwise, 404 for a path that is no title of a show's disc |

An address that is not `smb://host[:port]/share[/path]`, `http(s)://host/path`, `s3://bucket[/prefix]` (without a port), `sftp://host[:port][/path]` or `rclone://host[:port][/path]`, or that holds a user or password, is refused with `invalid_share_address`; a user longer than 256 characters or a password longer than 1,024 with `invalid_share_user`; an S3 bucket without an `http(s)://` endpoint, or with a region longer than 64 characters or holding spaces, with `invalid_share_endpoint`; a private key that cannot be read, or opened with its passphrase, with `invalid_share_key`; an rclone remote empty, longer than 128 characters or holding `:` or `/` with `invalid_rclone_remote`; `pollMinutes` out of 0 to 1,440 with `invalid_poll_minutes`. A folder's `folder` field gives `endpoint`, `region`, `rcloneRemote`, `privateKeySet` and `passphraseSet`, never the key nor the passphrase, `hostKey` and `offeredHostKey`, the SHA-256 fingerprints of the SFTP host key saved and of another one its server offers, and `pollMinutes`, null for the other folders; `error` may be `host_key_changed`. On **System › Health**, the problem of a folder (`code` `folder`) carries its error as `failure`, and `share` for a share. A folder that cannot be watched is a problem of its own (`code` `folder_unwatched`): for a local folder, its `failure` is `watch_limit` (on Linux, the limit of watches, ENOSPC), `instance_limit` (on Linux, the limit of watchers or of open files, EMFILE), `open_files_limit` (on macOS, the limit of open files, EMFILE) or `failed`, the only one on Windows; for a share, which carries `share`, it is `unreachable`, `refused`, `host_key_changed` or `failed`. A share's password the key cannot decrypt is listed among the stored secrets as `{"folder": name}`.

`GET /admin/api/health` lists the enabled shares under `shares`, each with its `id`, `name`, `share` (`smb`, `webdav`, `s3`, `sftp` or `rclone`), `pollMinutes` (null for SMB and WebDAV, 0 for a folder listed only at its scans, which is not watched), and `watch`: `notified`, `polled`, or empty while it is not watched. A polled share's `polled` tells why: `webdav`, `s3`, `sftp` or `rclone`, `unsupported` (the SMB server refuses change notifications), `silent` (it did not tell of a change a listing found), `failed` (its notifications were lost, and are asked for again), or empty while they are asked for. A notified share's `polled` is `partial` when its server missed a change in one of its folders, and its folders are listed every 2 minutes too. `unwatched` is the share's `folder_unwatched` failure, and `watchFolders` whether **Watch folders and shares for changes** is on.

Through the Jellyfin API, a local file is a media source of its title like any other, its `Name` the folder's name and its `Path` its file name. A Blu-ray disc's `Path` is its disc folder's name with the `.m2ts` extension, such as `Nosferatu (1922).m2ts`, or `Nosferatu (1922) - Disc 1.m2ts` for a folder named after the disc's number, and `Box - DISC02 - title 2.m2ts` for a title other than its main one. A playlist's media source, as a DVD's, has `SupportsDirectPlay` and `SupportsDirectStream` false, PlaybackInfo offers it only with a `TranscodingUrl`, and its download answers 400. A DVD's `Path` is its disc folder's name with its main title's `.VOB` extension, such as `Nosferatu (1922).VOB`, or `Box - DISC02 - title 2.VOB` for a title other than its main one; its media source has `SupportsDirectPlay` and `SupportsDirectStream` false, PlaybackInfo offers it only with a `TranscodingUrl`, and its download answers 400. A disc image's `Path` is its file name, such as `Nosferatu (1922).iso`, or `Box - title 2.iso` for a title other than its main one, and its media source plays as a DVD's does. A title of a show's disc is a media source of its episodes, named as a disc's title other than its main one: `Season 01 - Disc 2 - title 1.m2ts`, `Season 01 - Disc 1 - title 3.VOB` or `Disc 1 - title 2.iso`. A share's files are served the same way.

A title's local artwork is one of its images like the addons': its `ImageTags`, `BackdropImageTags` and `/Items/{id}/Images` list it by tags that change when the image's size or modification time changes, and `/Items/{id}/Images/{type}` serves it, resized as apps ask, from the folder or the share. Besides `Primary`, `Backdrop`, `Logo`, `Thumb` and `Banner`, a local image may be an `Art` or a `Disc` image. No path of the server's shows: `/Items/{id}/Images` gives no `Path`.

A home videos folder's `kind` is `homevideos` in the admin API, added with `"kind": "homevideos"`; it takes no `useArtwork`, its artwork always showing. Its `files` and `matched` count its videos, `unmatched` is 0, and `datedBy` counts them by where their dates come from: `{"nfo", "created", "file"}` (zero for other folders). Its unmatched list is empty, and its `titles` and `links` routes answer 404. Through the Jellyfin API, its library's `CollectionType` is `homevideos`, and its titles have `Type` and `MediaType` `Video`, `PremiereDate` and `ProductionYear` from their date, `Overview` from their NFO file's plot, no `ProviderIds`, and a `Primary` image, the poster beside them or a frame; they answer `IncludeItemTypes=Video`, never `Movie`. In the playback history and the statistics, their `kind` is `video`.
